  
Presentiment AVALANCHE -
(Introduction FMV. The camera pans slowly across a starfield for 
several seconds before we see a beautiful young woman looking directly 
at us. Green embers waft upwards around her face. The camera moves to show 
that the embers are generated by a Mako furnace in a dark alley as the 
woman stares into it. After a few moments, she turns and leaves the alley, 
a basket of flowers on one arm, and stops to stand at a street corner. 
Our view of her is momentarily obstructed by a massive train as it
speeds past through the town square. The camera swings outward through 
the dark, dingy square, under a stone arch, and then begins to swing 
upwards. The view moves higher and higher until the entire circular city 
of Midgar comes into view. The Final Fantasy VII logo appears for a few 
moments before the camera begins to swing back down, into a different part 
of a city. A train is pulling into a station in another dark alley. Two 
guards patrol the platform. Jessie flips spectacularly off the train. The
guards attack the intruder only to be knocked out by her skillful hands 
and feet. Barret hops out of the train, turns, and motions for another 
to follow.) 
Barret  
"C'mon newcomer. Follow me." 
(He runs upstairs. Cloud flips out of the train and follows
him. Two guards come down the stairs down to the train
platform, blocking his path.) 
 
(After the battle, Cloud runs up the stairs and meets the
group Jessie, Biggs, and Wedge, opening the main gate
to a Mako reactor.) 
Biggs: "Wow! You used to be in SOLDIER all right! …Not
everyday ya find one in a group like AVALANCHE." 
Jessie: "SOLDIER? Aren't they the enemy?" "What's he doing with us in AVALANCHE?" 
Biggs: "Hold it, Jessie. He WAS in SOLDIER." "He quit them and now is one of us." "Didn't catch your name…" 
 
Cloud: "…Cloud." 
Biggs: "Cloud, eh? I'm…" 
Cloud  
"I don't care what your names are. Once this job's over… I'm 
outta here." 
 
Barret: "The hell you all doin'!? I thought I told you never to move in a 
group!" "Our target's the North Mako Reactor. We'll meet on the bridge 
in front of it." 
 
"Ex-SOLDIER, huh? Don't trust ya!" 
 
Barret: "If you push the Directional button while pushing the [CANCEL] 
button to run. " 
(FMV sequence. The camera swings to show the Shinra headquarters towering 
above as Cloud following Barret through the
gate. Cloud follows the others to the Reactor. Wedge stays on the bridge 
in front of the reactor as the others head inside.) 
Wedge: "I'll secure the escape passage. Concentrate on the
mission, Cloud." "Geez, we're really gonna blow this huge furnace
up? This'll be somethin' to see!" 
 
Barret: "Yo! This your first time in a reactor?" 
Cloud: "No. After all, I did work for Shinra, y'know." 
Barret: "The planet's full of Mako energy. People here use it
every day." "It's the life blood of the planet. But Shinra keeps suckin' the 
blood out with these machines." 
Cloud: "I'm not here for a lecture. Let's just hurry." 
Barret: "That's it! You're comin' with me from now on." 
(Barret joins Cloud. The group works through the locked doors deeper 
inside the reactor.) 
Jessie: "Biggs and I got the code for this door." 
Biggs: "Code deciphered" 
 
Biggs: "Think how many of our people risked their lives, just for this 
code…" 
Jessie: "Code deciphered" 
(They go through the door and work deeper into the reactor. Biggs stays at 
the door. They enter an elevator) 
Jessie: "Push that button over there!" 
 
Barret: "Little by little the reactors'll drain out all the life. And 
that'll be that." 
Cloud: "It's not my problem." 
Barret: "The planet's dyin', Cloud!" 
Cloud: "The only thing I care about is finishin' this job before 
security and the Roboguards come." 
(Barret turns away, shaking with anger, then looks back over his shoulder 
at Cloud and rejoins him. The elevator stops and
Jessie gets off. They continue into the reactor.) 
Jessie: "Push the [OK] button in front of a ladder to grab on to it.
After that, use the [Directional button] to move up and down." 
 
Barret: "When we blow this place, this ain't gonna be nothin' more
than a hunka junk." "Cloud, you set the bomb." 
Cloud: "Shouldn't you do it?" 
Barret: "Jus' do it! I gotta watch to make sure you don't pull nothin'." 
Cloud: "Fine, be my guest." 
(As Cloud moves to set the bomb, the screen dims and something speaks into 
his mind.) 
Watch out! This isn't just a reactor!! 
 
Barret: "…What's wrong?" 
Cloud: "Huh?" 
Barret: "What's wrong, Cloud? Hurry it up!" 
Cloud: "Yeah, sorry." 
(Cloud sets the bomb. An alarm begins to sound and red lights
flash.) 
Barret: "Heads up, here they come!" 
 
Cloud: "Come on, let's get outta here!" 
Ten minutes to detonation! 
(They rush back out through the reactor until they meet up with Jessie 
where she had stayed behind. She has one leg caught in the grate she's 
standing on.) 
Cloud: "You all right?" 
Jessie: "My leg got stuck." 
 
"Thanks!" 
 
Biggs: "Let's go!" 
Jessie: "Code deciphered" 
 
Jessie: "Alright, be careful." 
Biggs  
"Code deciphered" 
(They go through the door and exit the reactor. On the way out, Jessie 
falls. Cloud helps her up and they sprint away. FMV sequence. The reactor 
emits a ring of fire as it explodes spectacularly against the night sky.) 




  
Escape From Mako Reactor 7 -
(Cloud, Barret, Biggs, Wedge, and Jessie are in a dark tunnel littered 
with debris and broken metal.) 
Biggs: "That should keep the planet going… at least a little longer." 
Wedge: "Yeah." 
Barret: "………" 
 
Jessie: "OK! Now everyone get back." 
(They stand back and a wall explodes, opening a way to a courtyard. Wedge's 
butt seems to be on fire.)
Barret: "All right, now let's get out of here." "Rendezvous at Sector 8 station! Split up and get on the train!" 
 
Cloud: "H, hey!" 
Barret: "If it's about your money save it 'til we're back at the hideout." 
  
  
Flower Girl A Daring Leap -
(A few people are running around a street corner, bumping into a woman 
standing there, knocking her down. She stands up and calmly brushes herself 
off. Cloud enters.) 
Flower girl: "Excuse me." "What happened?" 
You'd better get out of here: Nothing… hey, listen… 
Cloud: Nothing… hey, listen… "………" 
Don't see many flowers around here: Never mind 
Cloud: Don't see many flowers around here 
Flower girl: "Oh, these? Do you like them? They're only a gil….?" 
Buy one: Forget it 
Cloud: Buy one 
Flower girl: "Oh, thank you!" "Here you are!" 

(She gives Cloud a flower and walks off. Cloud continues through the 
streets of Midgar.) 
People on the street: "Just what the hell's going on!?" 
"Wonder what that is on the wall over there. Let's see…" Don't be fooled by Shinra! Mako energy doesn't last forever! Mako 
is the planet's lifesource! The end is in sight! Protectors of the planet: AVALANCHE 
 
Soldier: "Hey! You there!" 
Cloud: "Shinra soldiers…" 
Fight them: Leave 
Cloud: Fight them 
(Three battles with Shinra soldiers. After the third battle, Cloud is 
surrounded) 
Soldier: "That's as far as you go." 
Cloud: "I don't have time to be messin' around with you guys." 
Soldier: "Enough babbling! Grab him!" 
(The soldiers close in. Cloud backs away, but his path is blocked as he 
reaches a railing. Below him are the train tracks. FMV sequence. Cloud 
jumps off the balcony onto the train as it rushes by.) 




  
The Long Ride Home -
(Barret, Wedge, Biggs, and Jessie are riding in a train car littered with 
crates and junk.) 
Wedge: "Cloud never came." 
Biggs: "Cloud… Wonder if he was killed?" 
Barret: "No way!!" 
Jessie: "Cloud…" 
 
Biggs: "Say, do you think Cloud's…" "Going to fight to the end for AVALANCHE!?" 
Barret: "The hell would I know? Do I look like a mind reader?" 
 
"Hmph!! If y'all weren't such screw-ups…" 
Wedge: "Hey Barret! What about our money…?" 
 
Wedge: "Uh, nothin'… sorry." "Ahh……." 
 
Biggs: "Cloud!!" 
Jessie: "Cloud…" 
Wedge: "Cloud!!" 
Cloud: "Looks like I'm a little late." 
Barret: "You damn right, you're late!!" "Come waltzin' in here makin' a big scene!" 
Cloud: "It's no big deal. Just what I always do." 
Barret: "Shi't!" "Havin' everyone worried like that you don't give a damn 'bout no 
one but yourself!" 
Cloud: "Hmm….. You were worried about me!" 
Barret: "Wha!?" "I'm takin' it outta your money, hot stuff!" 
 
Barret: "Wake up!" "We're movin' out! Follow me!" 
 
Wedge: "Hey, Cloud! You were great back there!" 
 
Biggs: "Heh heh…. Cloud! We'll do even better next time." 
 
Jessie: "Be careful, I'll shut this." 
 
"Oh, Cloud! Your face is pitch-black….." 
 
"There you go!" "Say, thanks for helping me back there at the Reactor!" 
  

 
Last train out of Sector 8 Station. Last stop is Sector 7, Train 
Graveyard. Expected time of arrival is 12:23 AM, Midgar standard time… 
(Barret and the others come into the next car and sit down. They disturb a 
well-dressed, official looking man.) 
"This is why I hate the last train. Hoo-boy…" 
 
People on the train 
"Huh? This is my house, so make yourselves at home." 
"You see the headlines in the Shinra Times?" "The terrorists that bombed the No. 1 Reactor are based somewhere 
in the slums." "…blowing up a Reactor… they sure put some thought into this 
one." "They must have a real calculating leader. I wonder what they'll 
do next?" 
Barret: "Stop actin' like a damn kid. Si'down an' shu'up!" 
Wedge: "Someday AVALANCHE's gonna be famous …and me, too!" 
Biggs: "It seems this train hasn't switched to security mode yet." "I'm sure that will change by tomorrow." 
Jessie: "Hey, Cloud. You want to look at this with me?" "It's a map of the Midgar Rail System. Let's look at it
together. I'll explain it to you." "I like this kinda stuff. Bombs and monitors… you know,
flashy stuff." 
 
Jessie: "Okay, it's about to start." 
 
"This is a complete model of the city of Midgar." "It's about a 1/10000 scale." "The top plate is about 50 meters above ground." "A main support structure holds the plate up in the center, and 
there are other support structures built in each section…" "psst… whisper… whisper… (The No. 1 Reactor we blew up was 
in the northern section.)" "Then there's No. 2, No. 3 all the way up to the No. 8 Reactor." "The 8 Reactors provide Midgar with electricity." "Each town used to have a name, but no one in Midgar remembers 
them." "Instead of names, we refer to them by numbered sectors. That's 
the kind of place this is." "Phew…, this is next! Look." 
 
"This is the route the train is on." "The route spirals around the main support structure." "We should be coming around the center area, right now." "At each checkpoint, an ID sensor device is set up." "It can check the identities and background on each and every 
passenger on the train by linking it up to the central databank at Shinra 
headquarters." "whisper… whisper… (Anyone could tell that we look 
suspicious, so we're using fake ID's.)" 
 
Jessie: "Speak of the devil…" "That light means we're in the ID Security Check area." "whisper… whisper… (When the lights go off, you never know 
what kind of creeps'll come out.)" "…anyhow, we're almost back now. That's a relief." 
Biggs: "…snore…. heebeebeeheebee… snore… (Don't act so damn big, 
Barret… snooze…)" 
Barret: "Look… you can see the surface now. This city don't have no 
day or night." "If that plate weren't there… we could see the sky." 
 
Cloud: "A floating city… Pretty unsettling scenery." 
 
Barret: "Huh?" "Never expect to hear that outta someone like you." "…you jes' full of surprises." 
Barret: "The upper world… a city on a plate…" "It's 'cuz of that &^#$# 'pizza', that people underneath are 
sufferin'!" "And the city below is full of polluted air." "On topa that, the Reactor keeps drainin' up all the energy." 
Cloud: "Then why doesn't everyone move onto the plate?" 
Barret: "Dunno. Probably 'cuz they ain't got no money. Or, maybe…" "'Cuz they love their land, no matter how polluted it gets." 
Cloud: "I know… no one lives in the slums because they want to." "It's like this train. It can't run anywhere except where its 
rails take it." 
(FMV sequence. The train circles the support structure on its way to 
Sector 7. The train arrives at the station and everyone gets off) 
Barret: "Yo!! Get over here, all' ya!!" 
 
Barret: "This mission was a success. But don't get lazy now." "The hard part's still to come! Don't y'all be scared of that 
explosion!" "'Cause the next one's gonna be bigger than that!" "Meet back at the hideout!! Move out!" 
   
  
The Reactor Tower -
People at the train station 
"I'm not letting you go tonight." 
"Wow!" 
"Isn't there somewhere we could go to be alone?" 
"There's only the train graveyard around here. And they say 
there's ghosts around too!" 
"…damn." 
"What?" 
Person near Reactor Tower 
"Hey now! …Oops!" "What on earth are you doing? Just butt out… geez!" "Huh? You come to see it, too?" "There was a bombing on top. If this pillar should come down, 
everyone in the slums is dust…" "Well, there's no point in worryin' about that." "Hey! Look! It's huge, ain't it?" 
 
"Hey… This is a strange and wonderful place." "This is my place, but you can come here when you want.
Bye, bro!" 
 
Barret 
"Yo. Cloud! Over here, now!"  



 
-Welcome Home, Cloud! A Childhood Promise -
(Barret runs into Tifa's bar, the Seventh Heaven, and chases all the 
patrons out. Biggs, Wedge, and Jessie go inside.) 
Barret: "Ok! Go on ahead." 
 
"Yo! Cloud!! Get off your slow-movin' ass!" 
 
 
"Papa!" 
 
"Marlene! Aren't you going to say anything to Cloud?" 
 
"Welcome home, Cloud. Looks like everything went well." "Did you fight with Barret?" 
Yeah: Not this time 
Cloud: Yeah 
Tifa: "I should have known." "He's always pushing people around, and you've always been in 
fights ever since you were little." "I was worried." 
Cloud: Not this time 
Tifa: "Hmm. You've grown up." "When you were little you used to get into fights at the drop of 
a hat." 

 
Tifa: "Flowers? How nice…" "You almost never see them here in the slums." "But…" "A flower for me? Oh Cloud, you shouldn't have…" 
Cloud: "No big." 
Give it to Tifa: Give it to Marlene 
Cloud: Give it to Tifa 
Tifa: "Thank you, Cloud. It smells wonderful." "Maybe I should fill the store with flowers." 
Cloud: Give it to Marlene 
 

People in the bar 
Tifa: "Sorry, Cloud. Marlene seems a little shy." 
Marlene: "…………" 
Wedge: "Oh. Cloud!" "Tifa realls knows how to cook. Mmm, mmm……." "Anyway, let me tell you somethin'." 
About what? I'm not interested in your stories 
Cloud: About what? 
Wedge: "Tifa always lets me taste her cooking." "And look at me now, I'm rolly-polly." "Don't know whether I should be happy or sad. But it's the good 
food and drinks that make this shop famous." 
Cloud: I'm not interested in your stories 
Wedge: "Cloud…… ……..forget it." 

Jessie: "Careless….. You're getting all excited." "Wonder what for…..?" 
Biggs: "Aah!! Nothin' like that first drink after a job." "Hic!!" "Why don't you have one too?" 
No: Yeah, why not? 
Cloud: No 
Biggs: "What!? you tellin' me you're too good to drink with me?" "Don't act big-headed jus' because you were in SOLDIER!" 
Cloud: Yeah, why not? 
Biggs: "Oh!! That's more like it!" "Even if you were with SOLDIER, you're still a rookie here. So 
you'd better listen to whatever I tell ya!" 
Biggs: "Hic…!!" "Oh….. Don't tell Barret what I jus said." 

 
Marlene: "Papa, welcome home!" 
 
<If you gave the flower to Marlene> 
Barret: "Yeah." "Huh? Where'd you get that flower?" 
Marlene: "Cloud gave it to me." 
Barret: "Oh…." 
Barret: "Did you thank him?" 
Marlene: "………." "Thank you, Cloud." "We'll take care of you." 

Tifa: "You all right, Barret?" 
Barret: "Great!!" "Get in here, fools!! We're startin' the meetin'!!" 
(He descends a hidden elevator in a pinball machine. Everyone follows but 
Cloud and Tifa. Cloud walks to the bar.) 
Tifa: "Sit down." 
 
Tifa: "How about…" "…something to drink?" 
I don't feel like it: Give me something hard 
Cloud: Give me something hard 
Tifa: "Just a minute. I'll make one for you." 
 
Tifa: "You know, I'm relieved you made it back safely." 
Cloud: "What's with you all of a sudden? That wasn't even a tough job." 
Tifa: "I guess not…" "You were in SOLDIER." 
 
Tifa: "Make sure you get your pay from Barret." 
Cloud: "Don't worry. Once I get that money, I'm outta here." 
Cloud: I don't feel like it 
Tifa: "OHH!!" "I can make a drink just as good as anyone else." "Everyone says, my drinks taste the best!" 

 
Tifa: "Cloud, are you feeling all right?" 
Cloud: "…yeah… Why?" 
Tifa: "No reason. You just look a little tired I guess." "You'd better go down below." 
(Cloud walks to the elevator in the pinball machine and goes down. 
Everyone is busy downstairs. Barret is punching a bag.)
People downstairs 
Wedge: "You think I'm a litte too uptight?" 
Yeah… No… 
Cloud: Yeah… 
Wedge: "The next mission will be to blow up the Sector 5 Reactor." "Cloud, you're great! Don't you ever get nervous?" "Or are you like, impervious to feelings? Naw, that couldn't be 
it." 
Cloud: No… 
Wedge: "Well, that's ok. Don't worry about me. I don't look like it, 
but I'm a coward at heart." 

 
Jessie: "Oops…" "Hey, look at the news… What a blast." "Think it was all because of my bomb? But all I really did was 
just make it like the computer told me." "Oh no! I must've made a miscalculation somewhere."  

Barret: "Yo. Cloud! There's somethin' I wanna ask ya." "Was there anyone from SOLDIER fighting us today?" 
Cloud: "None. I'm positive." 
Barret: "You sound pretty sure." 
Cloud: "If there was anyone from SOLDIER you wouldn't be standing here 
now." 
Barret: "Don't go thinkin' you so bad jes cuz you was in SOLDIER." 
Cloud: "……." 
Barret: "Yeah, you're strong." "Probably all them guys in SOLDIER are." "But don't forget your skinny ass's working for AVALANCHE now!" "Don't get no ideas 'bout hangin' on to Shinra." 
Cloud: "Stayin' with Shinra?" "You asked me a question and I answered it… that's all." "I'm going upstairs. I want to talk about my money."  

Barret: "Shucks!! ……..money…." 
Marlene: "Papa. you're so great!"  

 
Tifa: "Wait, Cloud!" 
Barret: "Tifa! Let him go!" "Looks like he still misses the Shinra!" 
Cloud: "Shut up!" "I don't care about either Shinra or SOLDIER!" "But don't get me wrong!" "I don't care about AVALANCHE or the Planet for that matter!"  

Tifa: "Straighten things up with everyone for me." 
Television: ……today the No.1 Reactor was bombed. The terrorist group 
AVALANCHE has claimed responsibility for the bombing. It is expected that AVALANCHE will continue its reign of terror. But citizens of Midgar…. there is no need to fear. I have immediately mobilized SOLDIER to protect our citizenry 
against this senseless violence. Thank you and good night. 
Wedge: "…Cloud." "You say you don't care, but you came to talk to me." "Cloud…. you just want friends." "Isn't that right?" 
Blow off: I really don't care 
Cloud: Blow off 
Wedge: "Yeah, well. You look kind of lonely to me." If you ever got anything you want to get off your chest, you can 
always talk to me." 
Cloud: I really don't care 
Wedge: "You're terrible. Real cold blooded." 

 
Tifa: "Listen, Cloud. I'm asking you. Please join us." 
Cloud: "Sorry Tifa…" 
Tifa: "The Planet is dying. Slowly but surely it's dying." "Someone has to do something." 
Cloud: "So let Barret and his buddies do something about it." "It's got nothin' to do with me." 
 
Tifa: "So! You're really leaving!?" "You're just going to walk right out ignoring your childhood 
friend!?" 
Cloud: "What……?" 
How can you say that!  
…Sorry 
Cloud: How can you say that! 
Cloud: …Sorry 

Tifa: "You forgot the promise, too." 
Cloud: "Promise?" 
 
Tifa: "So you DID forget." "Remember…. Cloud. It was seven years ago…" 
(Cloud looks up. The  fades to black. It fades in again; Cloud and 
Tifa are standing by a well. The sky is full of stars.) 
Tifa: "Look, the well." "Do you remember?" 
 
Cloud: "Yeah…. back then." 
"I thought you would never come, and I was getting a little
cold."  

(The  changes. Cloud and Tifa, as children, appear. Cloud is
sitting swinging his legs on the well cover. Tifa enters from
offscreen.) 
Tifa: "Sorry I'm late." 
 
Tifa: "You said you wanted to talk to me about something?" 
Cloud: "Come this spring…. I'm leaving this town for Midgar." 
Tifa: "……..All boys are leaving our town." 
Cloud: "But I'm different from all of them. I'm not just going to find a 
job." 
 
"I want to join SOLDIER." 
"I'm going to be the best there is, just like Sephiroth." 
Tifa: "Sephiroth…. The Great Sephiroth." 
 
Tifa: "Isn't it hard to join SOLDIER?" 
Cloud: "…I probably wont be able to come back to this town for a
while." 
 
Cloud: "…huh?" 
Tifa: "Will you be in the newspapers if you do well?" 
Cloud: "I'll try." 
Tifa: "Hey, why don't we make a promise?" "Umm, if you get really famous and I'm ever in a bind….." "You come save me, all right?" 
Cloud: "What?" 
Tifa: "Whenever I"m in trouble, my hero will come and rescue me." "I want to at least experience that once." 
Cloud: "What?" 
Tifa: "Come on--! Promise me----!" 
Cloud: "All right…. I promise." 
(The camera pans up to show the starry night sky. A falling star streaks 
its white trail across the dark blue.)  

 
Tifa: "You remember now? …Our promise?" 
Cloud: "I'm not a hero and I'm not famous. I can't keep…. the promise." 
Tifa: "But you got your childhood dream, didn't you? You joined SOLDIER." 
 
Tifa: "So come on! You've got to keep your promise……" 
 
Barret: "Wait a sec big-time SOLDIER!" "A promise is a promise! Here!!" 
 
Cloud: "This is my pay? Don't make me laugh." 
Tifa: "What? Then you'll…!!" 
Cloud: "You got the next mission lined up? I'll do it for 3000." 
Barret: "What….!?" 
 
Tifa: "It's ok, it's ok." "psst, psst….. " 
Barret: "Uh….. ugh….. " 
 
Barret: "2000!" 
 
Tifa: "Thanks, Cloud." 




  
The Morning After Sector 7 -
(The  changes to Tifa's bar, the next morning. Cloud goes up the 
elevator. Tifa and Barret are standing, Marlene is mixing drinks.) 
Tifa: "Good Morning! Cloud!" "Did you sleep well?" 
Barret's snoring kept me up…… Next to you, who wouldn't? 
Cloud: Barret's snoring kept me up…. 
Tifa: "psstpsst…" "(keep it down, they'll hear you. Barret's always edgy before an 
operation.)" 
Cloud: Next to you, who wouldn't? 
Tifa: "I don't know what you mean." 

Tifa: "I'm going this time." 
Barret: "Our target's the Sector 5 Reactor. Head for the station first." "I'll fill you in on the train." 
Barret: "Yo! Cloud!" "Before the next mission, I got somethin' I wanna ask you!" "I, uh,….. I don't really know how to use Materia!" "I'll give you that Materia you found. Just teach me how to use 
it!" 
Cloud: "…sigh…" 
Ok, I'll explain it: You wouldn't understand 
Cloud: Ok, I'll explain it 
 
Sure. I'll explain how Materia works. First, access the menu. You know the basic functions. The triangle button brings up the menu. Directional buttons move the cursor. Like this. Select each menu by using the OK button. If you want to leave the menu, just push the CANCEL cutton. See? Let's go ahead. Now you're in this menu. Select [Materia] sub menu. Select who you want to use it. Now look at my weapon here. Each weapon and armor has slots in it. Choose which slot you want to put Materia in. Now select the Materia you want to use. This is curative Materia. If you want to know what its effect is, line the cursor up with [Check], and push the OK button. It's just like selecting battle commands. Just line the cursor up to [Magic], you can see that the available magic has increased. Now you can use new magic [Cure]. And that's all there is to equipping Materia. See? It wasn't that tough! When you want to remove any Materia, it's as easy as pointing to the materia slot, and pushing the triangle button. There's just one thing you have to be careful of. Whenever you equip Materia, your situation changes. Parts of you may become stronger… while others get weaker. Normally, when you equip [Magic] Materia, your magic power will get stronger. But your physical strength weakens. So, Materia's kind of a double'edged sword. On the left side of the screen, you can see the Materia's effect on you. It's wise not to overuse Magic Materia. But try out various things. Push the CANCEL button to exit the sub menu. Ok, that's about it. I'll give you some advanced tips later.  
Barret: "Shi….! What's this 'It wasn't that tough' crap!" "I'm clueless……" "Well, you handle the Materia then!" 
Cloud: You wouldn't understand 
Barret  
"So this is what makes them guys in SOLDIER so great, huh!?" "Ok, I'll ask Jessie again later. But you're in charge of the 
Materia!" 

[Materia System] Access the menu and select [Materia] to equip Materia. 
Tifa: "Cloud! I got a message from the Weapon Shop man upstairs." "He has something he wants to give you. Don't forget!" 
"Marlene, you watch the store while we're gone!" 
Marlene: "All right! Good Luck."  
 
Johnny: "I'm leaving. Goin' faraway. But when I come back I'll be a better 
man! This is goodbye!" "Hey! Childhood friend! You better take good care of Tifa!" 
 
People in Sector 7 
"Ah… Johnny's gone. You look a little disappointed." "I don't like to say it myself but, I'm just a lonely guy when
I'm not drinking." 
"I hope he doesn't get hurt." "That worries me the most." 
"Yesterday, everyone in town was peeking at the two of you
from outside the bar." "Tifa's childhood friend. That's a good one!" 
"Ahh! Now I ain't got no one to pick on!" 
"He used to give us nothing but headaches when he was
here, but now that he's gone…. I kind of miss him." "……strange, isn't it?" 
"Ha! Ha!….. I wonder if my son's already left?" "When it's just my wife and I here, you have no idea how lonesome 
it gets." 
"Listen! If there isn't anyone to listen, what's the use of 
getting gossip on everyone?" "Yeah, and you Mr. I-don't-care!" "I'll get a little more information that would pique even your 
interest. You wait and see!" 
"You dried up old geez. You tired?" "Why don't you rest up on the third floor of my house? "There's just one condition." "You gotta give me some cash." <1 gil> "Damn, man!! Just forget about it!" <10 gil> "Oh man, oh man…" "Go ahead and help yourself to the room." "Use whatever bed you want. Sleep tight, old guy." <nothin'> "Cheap %#*^……" <If you go in bedroom without paying> "This is a slum, so don't 
think you can stay for free." "What are you going to do?" "Doesn't just seeing the bed make you sleepy?" <10 gil> "Sweet dreams, pops." <no way> "Tough guy, huh!? You better sleep when you
can." "You'd better save when you can." "That's the trick to being tough. Remember that, old dude." 
"This is the Beginner's Hall." "You say you're a beginner? But your eyes say you're not." 
Cloud: "Don't mess with me. I used to be in SOLDIER. I'll tell you
how much I know…. an' for free too!" <Cloud gives a tutorial here> 
<pick up an "All" Materia>: "Hey! You got one right off!" "That was Materia. Next, take this [treasure chest]!" 
"This is the fabled [Save Point]!!" "At a [Save Pont] you can use a [tent] and/or select *SAVE*." "There's more, too. Look for something called secret." "Even if you are wiped out, if you save you can restart from that 
same point." "That way you don't have to worry when you've been wiped out." "This is jumping ahead a little but, when you leave Midgar…" "Once you get the world map, you can save anywhere you like. 
Remember that." That should be all you need to know about the Save Point. I'll probably see you again somewhere on the road. Take care! I'm a [treasure chest]!! Beginners make sure and keep an eye out 
for me!! 
 
Cloud: "You've got to hang in there. Your limit gauge is just starting 
to build." "Waaah!" 
Cloud: "OK! Now your limit gauge is full, go ahead and use it! Fight 
with your limit techinique." 
: "Great!" 
: "Magic! Magic!" "Help!" 
Cloud: "Calm down! When your enemy uses magic counter with [Magic 
Barrier] or [reflect]." "[Magic Barrier] reduces the damage recieved from magic by half." "[Reflect] bounces the attacks off you. But the number of times 
you can use it is limited so be careful." 
: "Great!" 
: "Wow! You sure are strong! I'm going to be strong, too!" "Me too!" 
Cloud: "If you want to get as stong as me you need to use Materia." "And you have to find the best combinations of them." "The type of Materia you put in your weapons and armor will 
determine how quickly your Materia grows." "Put Materia into the open slots in your weapons and armor. The 
possible combinations are limitless." "That's about all I can tell you. If you want to be like me, you 
have to have some natural talent."  
 "I still don't get it!" 
Cloud: "Listen kid, don't piss me off!" "That's all right. Just give it a try. Little by little, you'll 
get used to it." 
"Hey SOLDIER! Tell us about battles! We'll even pay you!" 
Cloud: "I'm not hard up enough to take money from guys like you. But 
I'll rap with you for a while."  
<Cloud gives battle tutorial here> 
"Heh heh… He'll forget about it. OH, you!" "Get my friend on the second floor to teach ya." 
"He, HEY! Waitaminit you!!" "You can't just walk outta here without buyin' somethin'…." "Might be unhealthy fer ya, if ya know what I mean." <sells 
weapons> 
"Ahh… Another slow day…" "If this keeps up, this store's goin' under…." "Can't sell any really good medicine in a slum like this." "Oh!! Look at this! This doesn't happen everyday. You a……. 
customer?" "Yes!! Welcome!! We sell! We buy!" 




  
The Train A Narrow Escape -
(Cloud arrives at the train station. Biggs, Wedge, and Jessie are waiting 
there.) 
People at the station 
"I've had it!" 
"Me too." 
"You know this is the first time we've ever agreed on something." 
"Yes…" 
"Well then, shall we…..?" 
"Yes……" 
 
 
Barret: "YO!" "Looks like this ain't no private car! So split up!" 
 
"….hoodlums again. God, don't I just have all the luck…" 
Barret: "You say sumthin'?" "I said, 'you say sumthin'!?" 
 
Barret: "Yo, look at that! It got empty alluva sudden." "What's goin' on?" 
"DAMN!" "I… it's empty because of… g, guys like you…" 
 
"Y, Y, YIPES!!" "You… you've seen the news, right? AVALANCHE says there'll be 
more bombings." "Only devoted employees like me would go to Midgar on a day like 
today." 
Barret: "You workin' for Shinra?" 
Shinra Manager: "I won't give in to violence…" 
Tifa: "Barret!!" 
Barret: "&$#%!! You lucky ^$#$,!" 
 
Cloud: "So, what are we going to do now?" 
Barret: "Shit! the hell you so calm about? you bustin up my rhythm…" 
 
Tifa: "Seems like they just finished connecting the cars. We're finally 
leaving."
Cloud: "So what's our next target?" 
Barret: "Hah! Listen to Mr. Serious-about-his-work!" "Awright…. I'll tell ya!" "Jessie's probably already told you, but there's a security
check point at the top plate." "It's an ID scan system checkin' all the trains." 
Tifa: "Which Shinra is very proud of." 
Barret: "We can't use our fake ID's anymore…" 
 
Good Morning, and welcome to Midgar Lines. Arrival time at 
Sector 4 station will be 11:45. 
Tifa: "That means we've only got three more minutes to the ID Check 
point." 
 
Barret: "Alright, in three minutes, we're jumpin' off this train." "Got it!?" 
 
Tifa: "Cloud, come over here! Let's look at the Railway Map Monitor."  

People on the Train 
"Hmm….? You're the only ones that'll talk to me or come to my 
house." "I'm impressed." 
Shinra Manager: "Waaaaah!!" "Don… don't worry about me. (oh man, oh man, oh man…!! I'm 
gonna brag to everyone at work about this…)"  

 
Tifa: "Hmm, it looks like you've seen this already…" "It's all right. Come a little closer." 
 
Tifa: "That's odd. The ID Check Point was supposed to be further down."  

Type A Security Alert!!! Unidentified passengers confirmed… A search of all cars will be 
conducted! Repeat!! Type A Security Alert!! Unidentified passengers confirmed… A search of all cars will be 
conducted! 
Tifa: "What's happening?" 
Barret: "What's goin' on!!" 
 
Jessie: "We're in trouble." "I'll explain later. Hurry! Get to the next car!" 
Barret: "^%#@%! Someone blew it…" 
Unidentified passengers located in Car #1: Preparing for Lock Down 
Barret: "Let's go! Keep it up!" 
 
Car #1: Locked Down: Upgrading to Level 2 warning 
Biggs: "Hurry!" 
Wedge: "They're gonna lock the door, sir!" 
Unidentified passengers located in Car #2: Preparing for Lock Down 
Jessie: "Just run!" "Changing to Plan 2!" 
People in Car #2 
"Gosh! You're adults but you're making such noise!" "Please behave while on the train!" 
"Does this mean we're in a major bind?" 
 
Car #2: Locked Down: Upgrading to Warning Level 3 
 
Barret: "Awright! We clear!?" 
Jessie: "Not yet. They're starting another search. If we're caught, we're 
done for!" "But, don't worry. If we move up the train, car by car, we should 
get past it!" 
 
Unidentified Passengers:: Moving to front of Train: Currently tracking location 
People on the train 
"Hee hee!" 
Johnny: "Later… goodbye… adios, Midgar!" 
 
Car #4: Locked Down: Upgrading to maximum security alert!! 
 
Barret: "All right!! We made it!" "Yo! This way!!" 
 
"Let's go!! We're gonna dive outta here!!" 
Tifa: "Scary… huh." 
Cloud: "Too late to be saying that now. Why'd you come along anyway?" 
Tifa: "Because…" 
Barret: "Hey you two! There ain't no time for that!" 
 
People in Car #4 
 
Jessie: "It's me, Jessie. How do I look, Cloud?" "Do I look good in a Shinra uniform?" 
<yeah…> 
Cloud: "You look great, just like a man." 
Jessie: "Yay!! I'm so happy…. I think?" 
<Not now> 
Cloud: "Just concentrate on our plan." 
Jessie: "You're right, sorry."  

Tifa: "Yeah!! I've made up my mind." "Watch closely. I'm gonna jump!" 
 
Cloud: "You don't care if I go first?" 
Barret: "A leader always stays till the end." "Don't worry 'bout me, just go!" 
 
"Yo! Don't go gettin' your spikey-ass hurt!" "It's only the beginnin' of the mission!" 
 
Barret: "Later! You take care of the rest!" 
 




  
Reactor #5 President Shinra -
 
Barret: "Good, so far everything's going as planned." 
 
"Better not let your guard down till we get to the Sector 5 
reactor." "Biggs, Wedge, and Jessie got everything ready for us. So MOVE it." "Well, the reactor's just down this tunnel!" 
(They walk down the tunnel, until they reach a grid of laser beams crossing 
the tunnel.) 
Cloud: "Those light beams are the Shinra's security sensors. We can't go 
any further." 
 
Barret: "That's one damn tiny hole. You tellin' me to squeeze into that 
to get under the Plate? No way!" "Yo, Cloud, what're we gonna do?" 
Look inside closely: Go down: Don't go down 
Cloud: Look inside closely 
Tifa: "There seems to be nothing that'll get us stuck in this duct." 
Cloud: "Yeah. If we go down this duct, we won't be able to come back up 
here." 
Barret: "Don't be wastin' time. Never know when the Shinra'll find us." "Cloud, you jes' gotta go." 
Go down: Don't go down 
 
Cloud: Go down 
Barret: "But, damn man, that thing gives me the chills." 
 
Cloud: Don't go down 
Barret: "Whaddya mean we're not goin' in? There ain't no other way
of gettin' to the Sector 5 reactor 'cept through here." 



(Cloud, Barret, and Tifa enter the ventilation ducts and work their way 
into the Reactor. Along the way they meet Wedge, Jessie and Biggs.) 
Wedge: "Cloud, this way. The reactor's up this ladder." 
Jessie: "I'm sorry." "The ID scan problem on the train was all my fault." "I made your ID card special… So that's why it happened." "I put my heart into making it. But I failed." 
 
Jessie: "Next time, I'll give you something more decent." "I'll be back at the hideout in the research room workin' on it." 
Biggs: "We're gonna pull out now. We'll meet up at the hideout." "Cloud, we're countin' on you to blow the reactor!" 
 
(The three work their way deeper until they reach the core. The
screen goes red and Cloud clutches his head and falls to his knees.
The  shifts as Cloud hallucinates. He sees the inside of a
Mako Reactor. Gears are spinning. On the floor lies a long, thin
sword. Tifa, as a younger girl, sometime between the well
flashback and the present, kneels on the floor. A man lies before
her, dead.) 
Tifa: "Papa…" "Sephiroth!?" 
 
"Sephiroth did this to you, didn't he!?" 
 
"Sephiroth…. SOLDIER… Mako Reactors… Shinra… Everything!" 
 
"I hate them all!" 
  

(Cloud comes out of his hallucination. The  changes back to Reactor 
No. 5.) 
Barret: "Damn man, get a hold of yourself!" 
 
Tifa: "You all right?" 
 
Cloud: "……Tifa." 
Tifa: "Mmm?" 
Cloud: "No… forget…… Come on, let's hurry!" 
(Cloud plants a bomb in the reactor. They hurry out. They reach a 
mechanism with three buttons.) 
Tifa: "Jessie said we all have to the buttons at once." 
 
Barret: "This way!" 
 
"Shinra soldiers!?" "SHIT! What the hell's goin' on?" 
Cloud: "…a trap…" 
 
Barret: "President Shinra?" 
Tifa: "Why is the President here?" 
 
President Shinra: "Hmm… So you all must be that… …what was it?" 
Barret: "AVALANCHE! And don't ya forget it! And you're President Shinra, 
huh?" 
 
Cloud: "Long time no see, President." 
President Shinra: "…Long time no see? Oh… you." "You're the one who quit SOLDIER and joined AVALANCHE. I knew 
you were exposed to Mako, from the glow in your eyes…" "Tell me, traitor… what was your name?" 
Cloud: "Cloud." 
President Shinra: "Forgive me for asking, but I can't be expected to remember each 
person's name." "Unless you become another Sephiroth." "Yes, Sephiroth… He was brilliant. Perhaps too brilliant…" 
 
Cloud: "Sephiroth…..?" 
 
Barret: "Don't give a damn 'bout none of that! This place'e goin' up with 
a big BANG soon! Serves y'all right!" 
President Shinra: "And such a waste of good fireworks, just to get rid of vermin 
like you…" 
Barret: "VERMIN? That's all you can say… VERMIN!" "Y'all Shinra're the VERMIN, killing the planet! And that makes 
you King VERMIN! So shu'up jackass!" 
President Shinra: "…You are beginning to bore me." "I'm a very busy man, so if you'll excuse me… I have a dinner 
I must attend." 
 
Barret: "Dinner!? Don't gimme that! I ain't even started wit' you yet!" 
President Shinra: "But, I've made arrangements for a playmate for you all." 
 
Tifa: "!? What's that noise?" 
 
Barret: "The hell is this!?" 
 
President Shinra: "Meet 'Airbuster,' a techno-soldier,. Our Weapon Development 
Department created him." "I'm sure the data he'll extract from your dead bodies will be
of great use to us in future experiments." 
Cloud: "…Techno-soldier?" 
 
President Shinra: "Now then, if you'll excuse me." 
(Cloud runs forward, too late to intercept him. President Shinra boards 
the helicopter and flies away… leaving Cloud and the others alone with 
Airbuster.) 
Cloud: "Wait, President!" 
 
Barret: Yo, Cloud! We've gotta do somethin' about him!" 
 
Tifa: "Help, Cloud!" 
 
Tifa: "THIS is from SOLDIER?" 
Cloud: "No way! It's just a machine." 
 
Barret: "I don't care what it is! I'm gonna bust him up!" 
  

(Airbuster explodes, taking half the walkway with it. Cloud is left 
hanging from a piece of broken metal. It's a long way down.) 
Barret: "It's gonna blow! Let's go, Tifa!" 
Tifa: "Barret! Can't you do something?" 
Barret: "Not a damn thing." 
Tifa: "Cloud! Please don't die! You can't die! There's still so much
I want to tell you!" 
Cloud: "I know, Tifa……" 
Barret: "Hey, you gonna be awright?" 
 
Cloud:  
Cloud: "………." "You worry about yourselves! I'm all right, but take care of Tifa!" 
Barret: "…Alright. Sorry 'bout all this." 
Cloud: "Stop talkin' like this is the end!" 
Cloud:  
Cloud: "Shit! Can't hold on much longer. Barret….. Hurry!" 
Barret: "Don't go cryin' like a woman. There ain't nothin' I can do for 
ya. Ya gotta do it yourself." 
Cloud: "Barret…" 

Barret: "Alright, then, later." 
(FMV sequence: the bomb explodes, knocking Cloud from the walkway. Tifa 
tries to grab him, but he is too far away. Cloud plummets from the upper 
plate down to the slums below.) 




  
Flowers Blooming In The Church -
…You all right? …Can you hear me? 
Cloud: "…..Yeah….." 
Back then… You could get by with just skinned knees….. 
Cloud: "What do you mean by 'back then'?" 
What about now? Can you get up? 
Cloud: "…..What do you mean by 'that time'? …..What about now?" 
Don't worry about me. You just worry about yourself now. 
Cloud: "…..I'll give it a try." 
"Oh! He moved!" 
…..How about that? Take it slow now. Little by little….. 
"Hello, hello?" 
Cloud: "…..I know." 
Cloud: "Hey… who are you?" 
"Hello, hello!" 
(The  fades in to show Cloud lying in the middle of a flower patch 
in the floor of an old church. The Flower Girl from Midgar kneels next to 
him. She stands. Cloud manages to sit up.) 
"You okay?" "This is a church in the Sector 5 slums." "You suddenly fell on top of me. You really gave me quite a
scare." 
Cloud: "……I came crashing down?" 
"The roof and the flower bed must have broken your fall.
You're lucky." 
Cloud: "Flower bed… is this yours?" 
 
Cloud: "Sorry about that." 
"That's all right. The flowers here are quite resilient because 
this is a sacred place." "They say you can't grow grass and flowers in Midgar." "But for some reason, the flowers have no trouble blooming here." "I love it here." 
 
"…..So, we meet again." "Don't you remember me?" 
Yeah, I remember you: Never saw you before 
Cloud: Yeah, I remember you: "Yeah, I remember…" 
You were selling flowers: You're the slum drunk 
Cloud: You were selling flowers 
"Oh, I"m so happy!" "Thanks for buying my flowers." 
Cloud: You're the slum drunk 
 
"Excuse me, but that's really rude!" "But I'll forgive you, because you bought flowers from me." 

Cloud: Never saw you before 
"…..I guess you don't remember. You were walking in a daze." "But I'll forgive you, because you bought flowers from me." 

"Say, do you have any materia?" 
Cloud: "Yes, some." "Nowadays you can find materia anywhere." 
"But mine is special. It's good for absolutely nothing." 
Cloud: "…..good for nothing? You probably just don't know how to use 
it." 
"No, I do… it just doesn't do anything." "I feel safe just having it. It was my mother's…." 
 
"Say, I feel like talking. Do you feel up to it?" "After all, here we are meeting again, right?" 
I don't mind: Got nothing to talk about 
Cloud: I don't mind 
"Wait here. I've got to check my flowers. It'll be just a minute." 
Cloud: Got nothing to talk about 
 
"….oh, I see." "Ahhh, I wonder whose fault that is. It takes a lot to grow them, 
you know. Poor flowers." 

 
"Just a little longer." "Oh!" "Now that you mention it….." "We don't know each other's names, do we?" "My name is…." 
 
"I'm Aerith, the flower girl. Nice to meet you." 
Cloud: "The name's Cloud." "Me…..? I do a little bit of everything." 
Aerith: "Oh…. a jack of all trades." 
Cloud: "Yeah, I do whatever's needed." 
 
Cloud: "What's so funny? What are you laughing at?" 
Aerith: "Sorry….. I just…" 
 
  
Meet Reno -
(Cloud and Aerith are in an old church. They turn to see a mysterious 
figure in the doorway…) 
Aerith: "Sorry, bad timing on my part." 
 
Aerith: "Cloud! Don't let it get to you!" 
 
Aerith: "Say, Cloud. Have you ever been a bodyguard?" "You DO do everything, right?" 
 
Cloud: "Yeah, that's right." 
Aerith: "Then, get me out of here. Take me home." 
Cloud: "OK, I'll do it… but it'll cost you." 
Aerith: "Well then, let's see……" "How about if I go out with you once?" 
 
Cloud: "I don't know who you are, but…." 
"You don't know me…..?" 
……I know you. 
 
Cloud: "Oh yeah…… I know you." "That uniform…." 
 
"…..Hey, sis, this one's a little weird." 
Cloud: "Shut up! You Shinra spy!" 
"Reno! Want him taken out?" 
Reno: "I haven't decided yet." 
Aerith: "Don't fight here! You'll ruin the flowers!" 
 
Aerith: "The exit is back there." 
 
Reno: "They were….. Mako eyes." "Yeah, all right. Back to work,
back to work." 
 
Reno: "Oh!" 
 
"And don't step on the
flowers……" 
 
"Hey Reno, you just stepped on them!" "They're all ruined!" "You're gonna catch holy hell!" 
  
Flee The Church -
(The  changes. Cloud and Aerith in the back room of the church. It is 
three floors high, and a large Shinra missle apparently crashed through 
them all, leaving gaping holes in them. They jump past the missile and 
climb a broken flight of stairs, reaching a break in the walkway.) 
Reno: "There they are, over there!" 
 
Aerith: "Cloud… that one!" 
Cloud: "I know… Looks like they aren't
going to let us go." 
Aerith: "What should we do?" 
Cloud: "Well we can't let them catch us,
can we? Then, there's only one thing left." 
 
Cloud: "Aerith! This way!" 
 
Cloud: "All right. I'll hold them off." 
Aerith: "Right. Make sure they don't get through!" 
Reno: "The Ancient is getting away! Attack! Attack! Attack!" 
 
Aerith: "Eaygh!!" 
Cloud: "Aerith!" 
Reno: "Think we killed 'em? They shouldn't have put up a fight, I say!" 
Aerith: "Cloud, help!" 
Cloud: "Damn!" 
 
"What's that…?" 
(The three guards attack Aerith. Cloud runs to the rafters and finds four 
barrels. He pushes them off, squashing each guard. The PLAYER controls 
this.) 
Aerith: "Thanks, Cloud." 
 
Cloud: "Aerith, this way." 
(She follows Cloud. They find a hole in the roof of the church and jump 
out to the outside.) 




  
Let's Go, Bodyguard! -
 
Aerith: "Ha, ha….. They're looking for me again." 
Cloud: "You mean it's not the first time
they've been after you?" 
Aerith: "…no." 
Cloud: "They're the Turks." 
Aerith: "Hmmm……" 
Cloud: "The Turks are an organization in Shinra. They scout for possible 
candidates for SOLDIER." 
Aerith: "This violently? I thought they were kidnapping someone." 
Cloud: "They're also involved in a lot of dirty stuff on the side." "Spying, murder… you know." 
Aerith: "They look like it." 
Cloud: "But, why're they after you? There must be a reason, right?" 
Aerith: "No, not really. I think they believe I have what it takes to be 
in SOLDIER!" 
Cloud: "Maybe you do. You want to join?" 
Aerith: "I don't know… But I don't want to get caught by THOSE people!" 
Cloud: "Then, let's go!" 
(Aerith follows Cloud. They jump across many rooftops and pieces of 
debris, heading away from the church. Cloud gets far ahead of her.) 
Aerith: "Wait… Wait, I said!" 
 
"Puff… wheeze…" "Slow…. down…. Don't leave me…." 
Cloud: "Funny…" "I thought you were cut out to be
in SOLDIER?" 
Aerith: "Oh! You're terrible!" 
 
Aerith: "Hey…. Cloud. Were you ever in
SOLDIER?" 
Cloud: "….." "…I used to be. How did you guess?" 
Aerith: "…Your eyes. They have a strange glow…" 
Cloud: "That's the sign of those who have been infused with Mako…" "A mark of SOLDIER." "But, how did you know about that?" 
Aerith: "……..Oh, nothing." 
Cloud: "Nothing….?" 
Aerith: "Right, nothing!" "Come on, let's go! Bodyguard!" 
 




  
Sneak Out At Midnight -
(Cloud and Aerith hop down from the rooftops across pieces of debris. They 
land on a dirt road) 
Aerith: "Whew! Finally made it off! Now what…" 
(She looks around, then scampers
forward) 
"My house is over here. Let's
hurry before they get here!" 
(Cloud and Aerith travel through the
Sector 5 slums to Aerith's small cottage.
They go inside.) 
Aerith: "I'm home, mom." 
 
"This is Cloud, my bodyguard." 
Elmyra: "Bodyguard…..? You mean you were followed again!?" "Are you all right!? You're not hurt, are you!?" 
Aerith: "I'm all right. I had Cloud with me." 
 
Elmyra: "Thank you, Cloud." 
 
Aerith: "So, what are you going to do now?" 
Cloud: "…Is Sector 7 far from here? I want to go to Tifa's bar." 
Aerith: "Is Tifa…… a girl?" 
Cloud: "Yeah." 
Aerith: "A girl… friend?" 
Cloud: "Girlfriend?" 
No way: Yeah, that's right 
Cloud: No way! 
 
Aerith: "Hee hee hee…." "You don't have to get THAT upset…" 
 
Cloud: Yeah, that's right 
Aerith: "Oh, how nice." 

Aerith: "Well, that's… nice." "Let's see, Sector 7? I'll show you
the way." 
Cloud: "You gotta be kidding. Why do
you want to put yourself in danger
again?" 
Aerith: "I'm used to it." 
Cloud: "Used to it!?" "….Well, don't know… getting
help from a girl…" 
 
Aerith: "A girl!! What do you mean by that!?" "You expect me to just sit by and listen, after hearing you say 
something like that!?" 
 
"Mom! I'm taking Cloud to Sector 7. I'll be back in a while." 
 
Elmyra: "But dear… I give up. You never listen once you've made up your 
mind." "But if you must go, why don't you go tomorrow? It's getting late 
now." 
Aerith: "Yeah, you're right, mom." 
Elmyra: "Aerith, please go and make the bed." 
 
Elmyra: "That glow in your eyes… you're from SOLDIER, right?" 
Cloud: "Yeah. Rather I used to be…" 
Elmyra: "…. I don't know how to say this, but…" "Would you please leave here, tonight?" Without telling Aerith." 
 
Aerith: "You need to go through Sector 6 to get to Sector 7. Sector 6 is 
a little"
"dangerous so you'd better get some rest tonight." 
 
Aerith: "Cloud…." 
 
Aerith: "Good night." 
 
Cloud: "Oh, man…" 
 
"…seem pretty tired……" 
Cloud: "…….!?" 
"I haven't slept in a bed like this ….in a long time." 
Cloud: "….Oh, yeah." 
"Ever since that time." 
(The  fades in. Cloud is lying on a bed in a one-room house. A woman 
is in the room, working in the kitchen area. She stops and walks toward 
him.) 
"My, how you've grown." "I'll bet the girls never leave you alone." 
Cloud: "…Not really." 
 
"…I'm worried about you." "There are a lot of temptations in
the city…" "I'd feel a lot better if you just
settled down and had a nice girlfriend." 
Cloud: "…I'm all right." 
"You should have…" "an older girlfriend, one that'll take care of you." "I think that would be the perfect type for you." 
Cloud: "I'm not interested." 
(The  fades back in. Cloud is lying on a bed on the second floor of 
Aerith's house. Aerith is in the next room.) 
Cloud: "…I must've fallen asleep." 
 
Cloud: "Sector 7's past Sector 6… I should be all right by myself…" 
(He sneaks past Aerith's room and goes downstairs. He exits the house, 
leaving Aerith behind.) 




  
Playground Ai -
People in Sector 5 
"Take care of yourself. It's the law of the slums. But to do 
that, first, you need weapons, right?"  
"Hmph…..! Everything President Shinra says is a lie." "But then again, you can't trust that AVALANCHE, or whatever you 
call them." "You can bat it around all you like. But in the end it comes 
down to wanting to be like those who live up above." "So who do you believe in? Oneself! Me! I never lie to myself, 
that's for sure!" 
 "And now for the news." "Due to a terrorist attack by the group named AVALANCHE, parts of 
Midgar that were temporarily out of power will be restored momentarily." "Following President Shinra's lead, Mayor Domino also spoke out 
public against AVALANCHE." 
"glug… glug…" "Now… no one… will find it… num…" "The top one… and the bottom one…" 
"…stare… hmph… we only trade items for gil here." (Sells 
items) 
"I don't care if it's scrap metal or materia. We can get anything 
here in the slums." "Got a lot of good materia here. Why don't you look it over?" 
 
"ooh…. aaah….. aghhhh…."  
 
Aerith: "You're up bright and early." 
Cloud: "How could I ask you to go along when I knew it would be 
dangerous?" 
Aerith: "Are you done?" 
 
"You have to go through the slum in Sector 6 to get to Tifa's 7th 
Heaven." "I'll take you there. Come on!" 
(Aerith runs out. Cloud follows. They cross a highway that has been 
more or less demolished until they reach an old playground.) 
Aerith: "The gate to Sector 7's in there." 
Cloud: "Thanks. I guess this is goodbye. You gonna be all right going 
home?" 
Aerith: "Oh no! 'Whatever will I do!?' …isn't that what you want me to 
say?" 
See her home: Take her to Sector 7 
Cloud: See her home 
Aerith: "Isn't that a little out of the way?" 
Cloud: "Yeah, I guess so." 
Cloud: Take her to Sector 7 
Aerith: "I could do that. But won't I be in your way?" 
Cloud: "What do you mean in the way?" 
Aerith: "Nothing!" 

 
Aerith: "Can we take a break?" 
 
Aerith: "I can't believe it's still here." 
 
"Cloud, get over here!" 
 
Aerith: "What rank were you?" 
Cloud: "Rank?" 
Aerith: "You know, in SOLDIER." 
Cloud: "Oh, I was…" 
 
"First Class." 
Aerith: "Just the same as him." 
Cloud: "The same as who?" 
Aerith: "My first boyfriend." 
Cloud: "You were… serious?" 
Aerith: "No. But I liked him for a while." 
Cloud: "I probably knew him. What was his name?" 
 
Aerith: "It doesn't really matter." 
(A huge gate opens in the back. A large carriage drawn by a chocobo comes 
out. A woman is riding in the back.) 
Cloud: "Huh? Hey, back there….." 
 
Cloud: "Tifa!?" 
 
Aerith: "That girl in the cart was Tifa? Where was she going? She looked 
kind of odd…" 
 
Cloud: "Wait!" "I'll go on alone! You go home!" 
(She doesn't listen. She chases the carriage offscreen. Cloud shakes his 
head and goes after her.) 
  
Miss Cloud? -
(Cloud and Aerith arrive in Wall Market, busy with the hustle and 
bustle of people. Aerith runs around, checking things out.) 
Aerith: "This place is scary in a lot of ways. Especially for a girl. So 
we've got to find Tifa fast." 
People in Wall Market 
"I just can't make up my mind. Mmm." "Huh? About what?" "Hmmm, don't make me say it. It's the shop down on the right." 
"Hey, you two. Why don't you get some rest?" "We have a beautiful room, how 'bout it?" 
"Aren't cats great? This one's a little big, huh?" 
"Hey boy! You shore got a good lookin' heifer there!" "Take her to Don's place, and you'll make a mint." 
"Whoa!" "Why don't you say something, if you're standing there?" 
 
"Please come in. Here's a free 'Pharmacy Coupon' if you enter 
now."
: "Welcome! Sit wherever you like!" "I'm gonna get another Pharmacy Coupon today." "umf… scarf… glub…" "I always get the Special." "It's thanks to the Don that we can eat like this." "umf… grunt… smack… Don't sneak up on me like that!" 
"It's a little early to start eating. Come back in a bit." 
"…We're closed now." 
"Oh… what should I do… Should I just buy it……?" 
"Welcome. Please take your time." 
"Don't push! Hooligan!" 
"All this trash. Can't we do anything with it?" "All this, belongs to the owner of the Weapons Shop. He keeps 
picking things up and saving them here." "Oh, you mean the owner who even has a tank in his shop." "But no matter how you look at it, it's just trash…" 
"Join the club." "Try it with us." 
"All right… 1, 2, 3. Squats are all in the rhythm." "I'm doing my best, bro'!" "How's… this!?" 
"Whew, times are bad." 
"…And then…" "Hmm, hmmm, oh really?" 
"Yes? If you want to order, do it at the counter." [Note: You 
don't seem to be able to order] 
"Hey, could you do somethin' for me? Someone's been in there 
all day and they're not comin' out. I can't hold it anymore!"  
: "HEY… someone's IN here… Don't look!" 
"You want somethin'? I don't wanna hear any complaints 'bout 
how things look." 
People outside the Honey Bee Inn 
Johnny: "Man… Should I go…. or not?" "I get so mental at times like this. I'm hopeless!" "Hey!! Aren't you…?" "What!! You mean, you're…. too?" 
Yeah, me too. Don't bring me down to your level 
Cloud: Yeah, me too. 
Johnny: "You're Tifa's childhood friend, and you brought a girlfriend 
to a place like this!?" "What kind of guy are you!!" 
Cloud: Don't bring me down to your level 
Johnny: "What… Me too. I decided this after a lot of deep thought. My 
last memories of Midgar… you know." "But… That guy over there kinda scares me." 

"What the hell!! You *%^&!! This ain't no #$*&^% show!! I'm busy 
right now!!" "I'm feelin' like there's gonna be a fight!" 
"Urrgh… no way… I can't go on." "Things aren't working out." "Between our differences and my pay, it just isn't cutting it." 
"Welcome!! Even unpopular dweebs, like you may meet your 
destiny here!!" "You looking for a girlfriend too?" 
You know a girl named Tifa? This place doesn't interest me. 
Cloud: You know a girl named Tifa? 
"Hey, you're pretty fast. Tifa's our newest girl." "But, unfortunately, she's having an interview right now." "Here at the Honey Bee Inn, it's customary for all the new girls 
to be taken to Don Corneo's mansion." "Don Corneo's a famous dilettante. Now he wants to settle down 
and is in the market for a bride." 
Cloud: This place doesn't interest me. 
"Hmm… Seems to like it just fine. Good for you." 

"The Honey Bee Inn is a private club. Only members can go in. 
Shoo, shoo."  
 
[Note: The whole  of getting into Don Corneo's mansion is very 
open-ended. Your results may vary. I have included all the dialogue you 
could encounter while getting the various items, as well as what happens 
when you reach the Don's mansion with different amounts of the items. 
Remember that it is NOT required to get all of the items, and no matter 
how feminine you get, it will not have any bearing on the progression of 
events through the game.] 
"This is the mansion of Don Corneo, the most powerful man in 
Wall Market." "Look, the Don's not into men. So don't let me catch you around 
here again…" "Hey, and you got another cute one with you!" 
 
Aerith: "Hey, this looks like the Don's mansion. I'll go take a look." "I'll tell Tifa about you." 
Cloud: "No!! You can't!!" 
Aerith: "Why?" 
Cloud: "You DO know… what kind of… place this is, don't you?" 
Aerith: "Then, what am I supposed to do? You want to go in with me?" 
Cloud: "Well being a man, that'll be pretty hard. Besides if I bust in 
there, it'll cause too much commotion." 
 
Cloud: "But, I just can't let you go in alone… Oh, man……" "First, we'll need to find out if Tifa's alright…." "What's so funny, Aerith?" 
Aerith: "Cloud, why don't you dress up like a girl? It's the only way." 
Cloud: "WHAT!?" 
 
Aerith: "Just wait. I've got a cute friend I want to bring." 
Cloud: "Aerith! I can't….." 
Aerith: "You ARE worried about Tifa, aren't you? Then come on, hurry!" 
[Sequence of events follows, in which Cloud gets various feminine items.] 
 
Aerith: "Excuse me! I'd like to get a dress." 
"Umm, it might take a little time. Will that be all right?" 
Aerith: "What's the problem?" 
"Well, my father, the owner, has been in a slump lately. You 
see, he makes all the dresses." 
Aerith: "And, where is your father?" 
"He's probably plastered at the bar." 
Aerith: "So… You're saying we can't get a dress unless we do something 
about your father?" 
"Yes. I'm sorry. He's caused so much trouble." "!" "You'd help me bring him back?" 
Aerith: "Well, if don't do something, we don't get a dress, right?" 
"Really!? Please help my crazy old dad. I just don't know what 
to do anymore…." 
Aerith: "All right, we'll do something. Let's go, Cloud!" 
 
Aerith: "Excuse us, are you the father of the girl at the Clothing Store?" 
"I own the Clothes Shop… but I ain't your father." 
Aerith: "I didn't say that…." 
Cloud: "Make me some clothes." 
"I don't make men's clothes. And I don't feel like makin' 
anything right now." 
Aerith: "Cloud, you wait over there for a second. I'll try and talk to 
him." "Why don't you go over there and have something to drink." 
 
Aerith: "You know, mister." "He always said that just once, he'd like to dress up as a girl." "So, that's why I wanted a cute dress for him…" 
"What!? A tough lookin guy like that?" 
Aerith: "So, how 'bout it? Will you make him one?" 
"…might be interesting. I was gettin' a little bored just 
makin' regular clothes." 
Aerith: "Then you'll do it for us?" 
"Yeah, all right. What kind of dress you want?" 
Aerith: "Something…" 
(You get to choose what kind of dress you get here. If you make these 
choices, you will get the Silk Dress, the sexiest dress. Any other 
combination will get you a non-sexy dress.) 
That feels soft 
Aerith: "And something…." 
that shimmers 
"Hmm, got it. Y'know I got a friend that has the same taste 
as him. I'll go talk to him." 
 
"Oh, you're here. It's ready. Go try it on." 
(They receive the Silk Dress. Cloud looks like he is dreading this. He 
steps into the dressing booth and we hear scuffling sounds.) 
Cloud: "How… do you put this thing on?" 
 
Cloud: "Whoa! What are you doing!" 
Aerith: "It's still not right. A wig! That's what you need!" 
 
"Umm, I thought you might, so I talked to my friend about 
getting one." "You know the gym? You'll find a lot of people there like you. 
Go and talk to them." 
 
Cloud: "…'like you'? Aerith, what did you tell him?" 
Aerith: "Does it matter? Anyhow, we got a pretty dress!" 
(They travel to the gym and speak to the man watching the squat-thrust 
match. We can only assume it is a man; he appears to be wearing women's 
clothes.) 
"You the one…. Who wants to be cute?" 
Cloud: "Cute?" 
Aerith: "Right." "And about the wig…" 
"Yeah, I heard. But it'll cost ya." 
 
"Urrrrgh!!!" "Big Bro!! The only way you're gonna get cuter is if you can 
beat the Big Bro!!" 
 
"That's right!" "So, you've got to compete with us!" 
"You're right. Let's do squats." 
"All right! We'll beat you out of this gym!" 
Cloud: "Are you…?" 
Aerith: "THE beautiful Bro?" 
 
"What? You didn't know? Always running around here saying 
Big Bro' this, Big Bro' that…." "Never mind that, come over here." 
 
"No. I'll explain the rules." "From the ready position, push Square button to squat, push X 
Button to get up, and push O Button to go back to the ready position." "So it's Square Button, X Button, O Button in that order." "Got it?" 
Cloud: Got it 
"Whoever has the most squats at the end of 30 seconds gets the 
wig." "I'm not going to lose." "Big Bro's wig is MINE!!" "Just be quiet…" "It's not fair for you to start right away. So, you want 
practice?" 
Cloud: A little 
"Then, start practicing!" 
 
"You had 20 squats." "Now let's begin the real thing. Start!" 
 
"He had 17 squats and you had 20 squats." 
[Your results may vary] 
"You're really something. Okay, I'm a man of my word, here 
you are." 
 
Big Bro: 'I'm so mad I'm so so so-- mad!" 
 
"Shut up! Don't cry just because you lost!" 
"Uuuhh, Bro's fists of steel cut to the bone!" 
 
[These are the only two events you need to do. The rest are optional.] 
 
"Hey man. Got a minute? I need to talk… man to man." 
Cloud: What is it 
"Really! I really appreciate it." "……I'm sorry but, young lady? Would you turn the other way, 
for a second?" 
Aerith: "Why…..?" 
Cloud: "……Aerith." 
Aerith: "Gosh!" 
 
"I'm sorry, lady." "Now here's the thing. Do you know that vending machine in the 
inn?" "I'm itchin' to know what they're selling in it. I just can't 
ask a girl to go get it." "What? Why don't I buy it myself? Well to tell you the truth, 
I got in a fight with the guy at the inn and can't go there anymore. 
Come on, so how 'bout it?" 
Cloud: I'll go 
"Good, thanks. I'll be waitin' here when you're done." 
Aerith: "Finished?" 
(They go to the inn and get a room there. Late that night, Cloud gets out 
of bed and goes to the vending machine in the hallway.) 
Cloud: "He means this?" 
Don't buy it: Buy the one for 200 Gil : Buy the one for 100 Gil: Buy the one for 50 Gil 
<//>
 
Cloud: "I got it." 
"Oh, really!! Hey!" 
Aerith: "Geez." 
 
"And, what was it?" 
 
"A protein drink set. That jerk. I'm gonna do so much more 
business than him, his head'll spin."
"Thanks, bud. I'm motivated now. Take this, it's not much…" 
 
[Buying a cheaper ??? at the Inn will result in a non-sexy Tiara] 
(Cloud and Aerith go to the Honeybee Inn. A guy on the path there 
gives them a members Card. They speak to the bouncer.) 
"Hey! Is that a 'Member's Card' I see shining in your hot 
little hand?" "Please, come in." 
 
Cloud: "…Hmm. That's how you'll fool them." 
Aerith: "……Hmmmmmmmmm. So that's how you fooled them." 
Cloud: "Let's go!!" 
 
"Poo, I uh, mean, Sir…" "Hurry…" "Please choose a room. (Gosh, he's so weird… but then again, 
they all are.)" 
(Cloud ducks into the dressing room for the Honeybees and speaks to them. 
Repeatedly.) 
"Hmm, hmm, hmm….." "Ohhh, I just can't seem to lose weight. Hmm, hmm, hmm…" "Sir!! You can't come in here." "" 
"Eyaah!" "Don't!" 
"Paste, paste, paste….." "(Oh God… here's another one of those guys. You know, the 
delicate type. Just ignore him, just ignore him.)" "Fluff, fluff, fluff…" "(Hmm! I guess he doesn't realize his position. I feel sorry for 
him. Just ignore him, just ignore him.)" "Pita, pita, pita…." "" "Mix, mix, mix…." "(What should I do… Is he following me? Really? What if he 
follows me home…?)" "" "Shake, shake, shake…" "(You think he's after me? Really? This guy makes me sick… And 
his eyes are weird too….)" "(Yeah, don't hurt these guys' feelings. Let's at least say 'hi' 
to him." "Uhh…. Hel… Hello." "What a nice day, today." 
Introduce yourself: Say goodbye 
Cloud: Introduce yourself 
Cloud: "By the way, I haven't introduced myself yet." "I'm Cloud, a jack of all trades." 
"Oh, yeah…? Welcome, Cloud." "" "Take care… Cloud." 
Cloud  
Say goodbye 
"BYE!! " 
<//>: "Eyaah!" "Don't watch!" 
" "Hey, what do you think about me?" 
Not interested: Whatever… 
Cloud: Not interested 
"NO WAY! I'M SO SHOCKED!!" 
Cloud  
Whatever… 
"Oh my!! Are you embarrassed? " 
Goto A 
<//>: "Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm……… hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm… hmm, hmm, hmm, 
hmm…" "Phew… …it's so tiring." "Oh!!" "Is something the matter?" 
Not yet….. …..Not really 
Cloud: Not yet….. 
"OH……!!" 
 
Cloud: ……Not really 
"Hmph…!! Listen you, not that it matters, but you sure do 
know how to make people mad." 

(Cloud exits the dressing room. He takes a peek through the keyholes of 
some occupied doors. Behind the first one, The Lovers Room….) 
Cloud: "….Woooo…ow!" 
 
"…wheez…." "Phew…." 
"What's wrong, Grandpa? You keep sighing." 
"…wheez… puff… You know, Grandma…" 
"You talking about this room?" 
"…whew… I know our son rented this for us and all, but…." "It's too nice for us. Big round bed, gorgeous tub, I just can't 
get comfortable." 
"Don't worry about it. It's a high class neighborhood, in the Big 
City." "You keep complainin' and we'll get into trouble." 
"…wheez…" 
 
Cloud: "…Wooo…ow!" 
(Lightning flashes… a guy in a tub… another standing… one is dressed 
as a king.) 
…The wind's calm now…. It's the curse of the resurrected Satan… Our beloved Queen does 
not awaken… The time is ripe… A legend has been passed on through generations… 
"Psst… " 
"…whisper… whisper… (We have a luncheon with President 
Shinra…)" 
"Psst….. " 
"Psst…. " 
"Psst…. " 
A legend has been passed on through generations…. …..the sought after Promised Land…. 
"Psst…. " 
….One with Blue Eyes…. 
"Psst….(It's like this every time we have a business trip to 
Midgar.)" 
…..and a Great White Sword on his back….. 
"" 
…. Will not lead to the Promised Land….. 
"Psst…. (What're you complaining about. You're just holding the 
lights. I've gotta wear this heavy armor!)" 
"Psst…. " "Psst…. (Oh yeah, did you hear? The President's wife found out 
about this little hobby of his.)" 
"Psst… " 
"Psst… " 
"Geez!! Mr. Prseident!! I mean, Your Majesty…" 
 
"Ohhh… I'm sorry. Please remove the ancient curse!" 
 
 
Cloud: "I'll take this room." 
"All right, Now all we have to do is enter the room." "You're not going to have a change of heart, are you?" 
Cloud: Don't make me repeat myself 
"Oh, don't be angry with me…. (Geez…. this one' probably the 
violent type….)" "All right, please." 
 
"This way, please." "Shall we begin?" "I guess since you chose this room, that would mean you…" "Hate being lonely?" 
I'm used to being alone: Cut the small talk 
Cloud: I'm used to being alone 
Cloud: "I'm always alone." 
Cloud: Cut the small talk 
Cloud: "I don't want to talk right now." 

"All right, all right. " "Come on, everyone's waiting."  

Everyone…? What am I doing? 
Cloud: Everyone…? 
Cloud: What am I doing? 

 
"Here they are." "All right, everyone." "One, two! One, two!" 
 
"Yeah!!" 
"One, two!! One, two!!" 
Muuki: "Wassup!!" "" 
Cloud: "Oh man…" "What should I do…?" 
I'm outta here. This could be dangerous…. 
Cloud: I'm outta here 
Cloud: "I've got no time to mess around with you." "Outta my way!" 
Cloud: This could be dangerous 
Cloud: "Looks like I'm going to be facing crises all my life…" 

Mukki: "…heave… pant…" "Don't be so embarrassed! Loosen up, bubby!" "…heave… pant…" "Let's wash off all our sweat and dirt together!" 
"Wassup!!" 
(They all move in towards Cloud. The camera pans up to the ceiling so that 
just the tops of their heads are showing.) 
Mukki: "Bubby! You're the intimate type, huh!!" 
 
Mukki: "…heave… pant… Wow!! Would ya look at that!" 
 
Mukki: "Isn't bathing great…?" "It soothes your heart." "How is it, bubby!?" "Feels good, huh?" 
………. It hurts 
Cloud: ………  

Cloud: "I don't feel good. Let me out…" 
Cloud: It hurts 
Cloud: "Too stuffy in here…" 

Mukki: "You'll get used to it. Try counting to ten." 
Cloud: "Ten…" "Nine…" 
Mukki: "Hey bubby, how old are you?" 
Cloud: "Eight…" "Twenty one…" 
Mukki: "You're less than half my age. I'm so jealous." "So how 'bout it…?" "Do you wanna join my "Young bubby's" group?" 
Not interested: ……….. 
Cloud: Not interested 
Cloud: …….. 

Cloud: "Seven…" "Six…" "Maybe in another life." 
Mukki: "Well, if that's how you feel… too bad." "We have a trip planned at a cabin out in the country." 
Cloud: "Five…" "Four…" "Three…." "Two…" "One…" "Alright, that's ten. I'm gettin' out." 
Mukki: "Why don't you stick around and play a bit?" "Daddy's so lonely…" 
 
Mukki: "Bubby!!" This is important to
me." "Here's a memento of our time
together!" 
 
Mukki: "Hope we meet again!" 
 
Cloud: "This is SOME underwear…. I'm supposed to wear this…?" "Well, if it's to save Tifa… I guess there's no way around." 
  

 
Cloud: "I'll take this room." 
"All right, Now all we have to do is enter the room." "You're not going to have a change of heart, are you?" 
Cloud: Don't make me repeat myself 
"Oh, don't be angry with me…. (Geez…. this one' probably the 
violent type….)" "All right, please." 
(Cloud enters. There is a bright flash of light and the room dims. Cloud 
walks forward and sees a ghost of himself, transparent, kneeling by the 
tub. The ghost rises and walks to him.) 
Cloud: "Hmm…..? You…..?" "What are you doing in a place like this?" 
 
"That's what I want to ask you. Should you be foolin' around 
here?" "You think problems will go away just thinkin' about them?" 
(The ghost rises, lifts his sword above his head… and falls forward, into 
Cloud's body. He falls and the screen goes black) 
"Oh no!" "Help! Someone…! Hurry!" 
"You can't change anything by just sitting back and looking at it." 
Cloud: "What are you saying?" 
"It's started moving." 
Cloud: "What has?" 
"Wake up!" 
 
"rub, rub, rub….. rub, rub, rub, rub…." "thump… pound…. thump… pound…" "poik… poik… …squish." 
Cloud: "Uh… OW..!!" 
"Wake up!!" 
 
"Wake up!!" 
(Screen fades in to show Mukki straddling Cloud and slapping him upside 
the head. Cloud sits up and Mukki flops down on the bed.) 
"Phew, I'm so relieved." 
Mukki: "Bubby!! I heard you collapsed." "No, no, no." "Don't get so uptight." 
Huh…? Ugh…? 
Cloud: Huh…? 
Cloud: Ugh…? 

Mukki: "Hmm…? They say youth is so long but so short." "Let's give this next one your best shot." 
 
Mukki: "Time's up. Bye, buddy." 
 
Mukki: "Don't get depressed over a thing like this." "It happens to me all the time." 
 
"I'm so sorry… There's a lot of 'adult' things going on…" "For your inconvenience, please take this, okay?" 
 
Cloud: "What, this rag? For me!? I just don't get it." 
  

 
"………." 
Cloud: "If I were to dress up like a woman… Then I've got to really 
prepare carefully." "Seems like I could put makeup on here." 
Have them put makeup on : Don't do it 
Cloud: Have them put makeup on: "I have a favor to ask of you. Can you put makeup on me too?" 
"…paste, paste, paste….." "Oh… my….." 

 
"Uh, sir!! It's almost closing time…" "So, please remember any personal belongings." 
 
"Uuuuuh! I want flowers too! But, I get so nervous in front of 
cute girls…" "It just seems more natural to get cautious…" 
Aerith: "Hey!! Cloud!!" 
 
"Yes, what will you have?" 
Cloud: "Hmm…" 
Korean B.B.Q. Plate: Sushi Plate: Today's Special 
Cloud: Today's Special 
"One Today's Special." 
"Comin' up!" 
"In this store, you pay first. It'll be 70 Gil." 
 
"Thank you. Just a second." 
 
"There you go. Enjoy." 
 
……….. It was all right : I've had better dog food 
[Only "It was all right" will get you the Coupon.] 
"Thank you. Here's an item coupon for the Pharmacy." "You can exchange it for one item there." "We're out of coupons, so we stopped giving them away. Watch for 
our NEXT promotion!" 
 
"Whoa!" "Why don't you say something, if you're standing there?" "Oh, you have a coupon. Then please select any one medicine you 
like." 
Disinfectant: Deodorant: Digestive  
"Here you are." 
(He gives him the Digestive. They go to the bar and speak to the guy in 
the bathroom.) 
"HEY… someone's IN here… Don't look!" "What… urk…" 
Cloud: Give her medicine 
"Huh? You'll really give me some? Thanks." "Phew, I feel better now. This is for your kindness." 
 
[If you did not choose the Digestive, you would get a non-sexy cologne.] 
 
Aerith: "Aren't you going to change?" 
Cloud: Okay… I'm ready 
 
"Hmm, not bad. This may be a new business for me." 
"Yeah, you're right. Should we try it?" "Thanks for showing us something new. My father's got his 
motivation back now. So the dress is on the house." 
Aerith: "Walk more nicely like… this. Miss Cloud." 
Cloud: "What do you mean 'nicely'?" 
 
Aerith: "Oh you're so cute, Miss Cloud." "Aaah, I want one. Do you have one that'll look good on me too?" 
"How's this?" 
"How about that one?" 
"Father, what are you talking about? This one's much better." 
"No, what are you saying? This one." 
 
Aerith: "…I want THIS one." 
 
Aerith: "I'm going to go change." 
 
Aerith: "……No peeking!" 
 
Aerith: "So? How do I look?" 
 
Aerith: "Oh, you're no fun!" 




  
Rescue Tifa From Don Of The Slums -
 
"Damn!! Your friend's hot, too!" "Come in, come in!!" "Two ladies coming through!" 
 
"Hey, ladies." "I'll go and let the Don know you're here. Wait here. Don't go 
wandering around…" 
Aerith: "Now's our chance. Let's find Tifa." 
(Cloud goes upstairs and through a door. He comes out in a torture chamber. 
Aerith follows. They see Tifa there, dressed like… .. a slut, to be blunt 
about it.) 
Aerith: "…Tifa?" "Nice to meet you. I'm Aerith." "Cloud's told me a lot about you." 
Tifa: "…And you are?" "Hey you're the one with Cloud in
the park…" 
Aerith: "Right, with Cloud." 
Tifa: "Oh….." 
Aerith: "Don't worry. We just met. It's nothing." 
Tifa: "What do you mean, 'Don't worry'… about what?" "No, don't misunderstand." "Cloud and I grew up together. Nothing more." 
Aerith: "Poor Cloud, having to stand here and listen to both of us call 
him nothing." 
 
Aerith: "Right, Cloud?" 
Tifa: "Cloud?" 
 
Tifa: "????" "Cloud!?" "Why are you dressed like that!? And what are you doing here!?" "Forget that, what happened to you after the fall!? Are you 
hurt!?" 
Cloud: "Hey, give me a chance to explain." "I'm dressed like this… because there was no other way to get 
in here." "I'm all right. Aerith helped me out." 
Tifa: "Oh, Aerith did…" 
Cloud: "Tifa, explain. What are you doing in a place like this?" 
Tifa: "Yeah, ummmm…." 
Aerith: "Ahem! I'll just plug my ears." 
 
Tifa: "I'm glad you're OK." 
Cloud: "Thanks. What happened?" 
Tifa: "When we got back from the Number 5 reactor, there was this weird 
man." "So Barret caught him and squeezed some information out of him." 
Cloud: "That's when the Don's name popped up." 
Tifa: "Right, Don Corneo." "Barret told me to leave the lech alone…" "But something's been bothering me." 
Cloud: "I see. So you wanted to get the story straight from Corneo's 
mouth." 
Tifa: "So I made it here, but now I'm in a bind." "Corneo is looking for a bride." "Everyday, he gets three girls, chooses one of them, and then…. 
…and, well….." "Anyway, I have to be the girl… or I'm out for tonight." 
 
Aerith: "Sorry… but I overheard…" "If you know the three girls, there's no problem, right?" 
Tifa: "I guess so, but…" 
Aerith: "We have two here, right?" 
Cloud: "No, Aerith! I can't have you get involved." 
Aerith: "Oh? So it's all right for Tifa to be in danger?" 
Cloud: "No, I don't want Tifa in…." 
 
Tifa: "Is it all right?" 
 
Aerith  
"I grew up in the slums… I'm used to danger." 
 
Aerith: "Do you trust me?" 
Tifa: "Yes. Thanks, Ms. Aerith." 
Aerith: "Call me Aerith." 
 
"He---y!!" 
 
"It's time, ladies. The Don is waiting!" 
 
"I told ya not to wander around… I tell ya, women nowadays…" "Hurry up, will ya!" 
Cloud: "I probably don't need to ask but the other girl is…" "Me…… right?" 
Tifa: You're right, there was no need…" 
 
Aerith: "…to ask." 
  

(Cloud, Aerith, and Tifa enter the Don's room. He is seated at a desk, 
with a flunky on either side.) 
Kotch: "All right, ladies!" "Line up in front of the Don!" 
 
Don Corneo: "Hmmm! Good, splendid!" 
(He jumps over his desk and checks out
Aerith.) 
Don Corneo: "Now, let's see… Which girl
should I choose? Hmm-- hmm---!" 
(He checks out Cloud, who tries to face
away.) 
Don Corneo: "This one?" 
 
Don Corneo: "Or this one?" 
 
Don Corneo: "Woo-hoo, I've made up my mind!!" "My choice for tonight is….." 
 
<CHOICE> (Not really a choice, the next events depend on how many feminine 
items you have) 
[If you don't have many feminine items] 
 
Don Corneo: "This little beauty!" 
Tifa: "Fu, fu, fu…. Be nice, Don." 
[If you have a fair amount of feminine items] 
 
Don Corneo: "This slender little girl!" 
 
Aerith: "Don, you've got great taste." 
[If you have ALL the feminine items…] 
 
Don Corneo: "This healthy-looking girl!" 
Cloud: "Wa, wait a sec! I mean, uh, please wait a moment!" 
Don Corneo: "Woo-hoo!" "I love chickies who play hard to get! Yeowza!" 

 
Don Corneo: "You can have the other ones!" 
"Yes, sir! Thank you sir!" 
 
Don Corneo: "Well then, shall we go my pretty?" 
 
  
Lounge Chaos -
[If Cloud was picked go to the next scene] 
[If Cloud was not picked] 
 
Scotch: "Hey guys! We've got guests." "We'll take REAL good care of you." "This is all thanks to the big boss, Don Corneo!" 
"Heey!! Three cheers for Don Corneo!" 
Scotch: "Heh, heh…. Well ladies, are we, uh, all ready?" 
 
Scotch: "Hey… what's wrong? Want me to keep you company?" 
Cloud: "No… I'm flattered, but no thanks." "Because…" 
Scotch: "Because…?" 
Cloud: "Because…" "I ain't INTERESTED in a buncha scrubs like you!" 
 
Scotch: "Wha…. a MAN!???" "God damn it! You think you can get away with this! Get him! 
Knock the crap out of him!!" 
 
Scotch: "Grr! C'mon, what's the matter with you good for nothings!?" "All right now, COME ON! I'll show you how it's done!!" 
 
[If Aerith was picked] 
 
Tifa: "Cloud!!" 
Cloud: "Tifa!!" 
You all right? We've gotta help Aerith!! 
Cloud: You all right? 
Tifa: "Of course! If you take me lightly, you're gonna pay for it!!" 
Cloud: We've gotta help Aerith!! 
Tifa: "Hey, don't you even care about how I am? ……never mind, let's 
go!" 

 
[If Tifa was picked] 
(Cloud is about to go in to the Don's room when Aerith screams from the 
torture chamber.) 
Aerith: "No--!! Help!!" 
 
Aerith: "No-!!" 
Kotch: "Ha ha ha… Wait, you!" 
(Cloud looks down. Kotch is comically chasing Aerith around in circles. 
Aerith runs up the stairs and Kotch follows. When Aerith reaches Cloud, 
she kicks Kotch in the crotch.) 
Aerith: "I'm so sorry!" 
 
Kotch: "oh, oh, oh…." 
 
Kotch: "heh, heh, heh…" 
Cloud: "Aerith!!" 
You all right? We gotta help Tifa! 
Cloud: You all right? 
Aerith: "I told you. I'm used to danger." "To tell you the truth, my heart was pounding." 
Cloud: We gotta help Tifa! 
Aerith: "Ye… yes, you're right… …..let's hurry!" 
 




  
Ecchi Don -
(Don Corneo and the girl he chose are sitting in his extravagantly and 
tastelessly decorated bedroom. It smacks of 'Love Hotel'.) 
[If Tifa was picked] 
Don Corneo: "Woo-hoo!" "Come, come, don't be so shy…" 
Tifa: "I know…." "But you know, Don Corneo, I'd like you to explain something 
before we start…" 
Don Corneo: "Hm? Oh, you mean about THAT?" "Don't worry. I'm single. There, feel better now?" 
 
Tifa: "No… I'm not asking about that……" "Wa… wait a minute! No, not yet!!" 
 
Don Corneo: "Come! Come!" "Aooooooh!! I can't wait any longer! Here comes papa!!" 
 
Tifa: "Cloud!!" 
(Don does a belly flop at Tifa. She hops out of the way, and Don comes 
down face first.) 
Don Corneo: "Wha… what the hell? Who goes there?" 
Tifa: "You still don't get it do you, Don Corneo?" 
 
Don Corneo: "Get what?"  

[If Aerith was picked] 
Don Corneo: "Woo-hoo!" "Come, come, don't be so shy…" 
Aerith: "Ye… yes…" "But Mr. Don. I'd like you to explain something to me first…" 
Don Corneo: "Of course, my dear. I'll take you through it slowly, step by 
step. So come on!" 
 
Aerith: "No, that's not what I meant!" "NO, STOP! Just, wait a second!!" 
 
Don Corneo: "Come! Come!" "Aoooooh!! I can't wait any longer! Here comes papa!!" 
 
Aerith: "Cloud!!" 
(Don does a belly flop at Aerith. She hops out of the way, and Don comes 
down face first.) 
Don Corneo: "Wha… what the hell? Who goes there!?" 
Aerith: "I'm sorry, Don." 
 
Don Corneo: "Get what?"  

[If Cloud was picked] 
Don Corneo: "Ahh, we're finally alone…" "All right, pussycat… Come to daddy!" 
 
Don Corneo: "You're so cute, I never get tired of looking at you." "Do you like me, too?" 
Of course! Ummm……. 
Cloud: Of course! 
 
Cloud: Umm…… 
 
Don Corneo: "You don't like me?" "There isn't someone else, is there?" 
No, only you: Yes, his name's Barret… 
Cloud: Yes, his name's Barret… 
Don Corneo: "No way!" "Hmm? Barret? That sounds familiar…" 
Cloud: "You know, he's one of the ones you were trying to find out 
about. You know, AVALANCHE…?" 
Don Corneo: "Oh, yeah, yeah. In Sector 7 in the slum…" 
 
Don Corneo: "…and how do YOU know that!?" 
Goto C 
Cloud: No, only you 
 
Don Corneo: "You sure do know how to make a guy feel good!" "Then wh… what do you want to DO?" 
Whatever YOU want, daddy: Don't really care….. 
Cloud: Don't really care 
Goto  
Cloud: Whatever YOU want, daddy 
Don Corneo: "Oh man! I can't stand it! All right, then…." 
 
Don Corneo: "Give me a kiss! A KISS!!" 
All right….. Nope, can't do that…. 
Cloud: All right…… 
 
"Ju---st a minute!!" 
 
Tifa: "Cloud…" "Were you really…" 
 
Don Corneo: "A man!? What's goin' on?" 
Cloud: Nope, can't do that…. 
Don Corneo: "Why? WHY? WHY?" 
 
Cloud: "Because…" 
 
Cloud: "Because I'm gonna have to use that mouth of yours to give me 
some information!!" 
 
 
Don Corneo: "A man!? You tricked me!!" "Somebody get in here NOW!!" 
"Unfortunately, no one'll be comin' to help." 
 
Don Corneo: "You're the ones from before! Wh… what the hell's going on?" 




  
I'll Smash Them 
 
Tifa: "Shut up, we're asking the questions now…" "What did your assistants find out? Talk! If you don't tell 
us…" 
 
Cloud: "…I'll chop them off." 
 
Don Corneo: "No! Not that! I'll talk! I'll tell you everything!" 
Tifa: "So… talk." 
Don Corneo: "…I made 'em find out where the man with the gun-arm was. But 
that's what I was ordered to do." 
Tifa: "By who?" 
Don Corneo: "No--! If I told you that, I'd be killed!" 
Tifa: "Talk! If you don't tell us…" 
 
Aerith: "…I'll rip them off." 
Don Corneo: "Waaaaah--! It was Heidegger of Shinra!" "Heidegger, the head of Public Safety Maintenance!" 
Cloud: "The head of Public Safety Maintenance?" 
Tifa: "Did you say the Shinra!? What are they up to!? Talk!" "If you don't tell us…" 
 
Tifa: "I'll smash them." 
Don Corneo: "…You're serious, aren't you…. …ohboy, ohboy, ohboy." "… I'm not fooling around here either, you know." "Shinra's trying to crush a small rebel group called AVALANCHE, 
and want to infiltrate their hideout." "And they're really going to crush them… literally." "By breaking the support holding up the plate above them." 
 
Tifa: "Break the support!?" 
Don Corneo: "You know what's going to happen? The plate'll go PING" "and everything's gonna go BAMMM!! I heard their hideout's in the 
Sector 7 Slums…" "I'm just glad it's not here in Sector 6." 
Tifa: "They're going to wipe out the Sector 7 Slums!?" 
  
Tifa: "Cloud, will you come with me to Sector 7?" 
Cloud: "Of course, Tifa." 
 
Don Corneo: "Just a second!" 
Cloud: "Shut up!" 
Don Corneo: "No wait, it'll only take a second." "How do you think scum like me feels when they babble on about the 
truth?" 
They've pretty much given up on life: They're sure they'll win: They don't know what the hell's going on 
Cloud: They've pretty much given up on life 
Don Corneo: "Buuzzzzz! Wrong!" 
Cloud: They're sure they'll win 
Don Corneo: "Woo-hoo! Right!" 
Cloud: They don't know what the hell's going on 
Don Corneo: "Close, but no cigar!" 

(He flips a switch and Cloud, Aerith, and Tifa fall through a trap door to 
the sewer below…) 
  
Shinra Plans -
(Heidegger approaches President Shinra's desk in the Shinra building. 
Reeve stands by the desk.) 
President Shinra: "How are the preparations going?" 
Heidegger: "Ha, ha, ha!! Smoothly, very smoothly! I assigned the Turks to 
this." 
Reeve: "President!! Are we really going to do this? Simply destroy a 
group with only a few members…" 
President Shinra: "What's the problem, Reeve? You want out?" 
 
Reeve: "…No." "But, as head of the Urban Development Department, I have been 
involved in the building and running of Midgar. That's why…" 
Heidegger: "Reeve, you should flush those personal problems in the morning!" 
Reeve: "The Mayor's against this anyway…." 
 
Heidegger: "Mayor?" "He just sits in his building all day feeding his face! You 
still call that a Mayor?" 
 
Heidegger: "Now if you'll excuse me sir!" 
(He leaves. Reeve follows after him a few steps, then stops, his arm 
outstretched.) 
President Shinra: "You're tired. Why don't you take a couple of days off and go 
somewhere." 
 
President Shinra: "We'll destroy Sector 7 and report that AVALANCHE did it. Then 
we'll send in the rescue operation care of Shinra, Inc… Heh, heh, heh… 
this is perfect." 




  
Encounter At The Reactor Tower -
(Cloud, Tifa, and Aerith fall down a chute, landing in a sewer. Cloud gets 
up and walks over to Aerith.)
Cloud: "You alright?" 
 
Aerith: "Yeah." 
 
Cloud: "You alright?" 
Tifa: "Man! This is terrible." 
Aerith: "Well, the worst is over…" 
 
Aerith: "Maybe not…" 
 
Tifa: "It's too late….. Marlene… Barret… the people of the slums." 
Aerith: "Don't give up, never give up hope. It's not easy to destroy the 
pillar, right?" 
Tifa: "……Yeah….. you're right! We still have time." 
(They work their way out of the sewer, arriving at the Train Graveyard, a 
vast wasteland of broken trains and rubble.) 
Cloud: "Aerith. I got you mixed up in all of this…" 
Aerith: "Don't tell me to go home." 
 
Tifa: "Let's see… If we can just get past the trains that are lit up, 
we should be able to get out of here." 
(They climb over and through the trains in the Graveyard until they reach 
the Reactor Tower. Several people are milling around the base of it, and 
we hear noises of shooting from above.) 
Tifa: "We made it! The pillar's
standing!" 
Cloud: "Wait! You hear something…. above us?" 
Aerith: "…..gun fire?" 
(The camera shifts to show the tower, slowly panning upward, until we see 
the top of the tower. Guns are blazing. At the top, we see a flash of 
gunfire, then someone falls twenty stories down to land at the base of the 
tower. It's Wedge. Cloud dashes over and kneels by him.) 
Cloud: "Wedge!! You all right!?" 
Wedge: "…….Cloud…… You remembered….. my name." "Barret's up top. …help him……." "An' Cloud…. Sorry, I wasn't any help." 
 
Cloud: "I'm going up!" "Aerith! You look after Wedge." 
 
Tifa: "Aerith, do me a favor." "I have a bar called '7th Heaven' in this neighborhood." "There's a little girl named Marlene there……" 
 
Aerith: "Don't worry. I'll put her somewhere safe." 
Tifa: "It's dangerous here!" "Everyone get away from the pillar, quickly!" "Everyone get out of Sector 7!" 
 
People by the tower 
"L, look… This is my job, so I have to be here until the 
absolute last minute." "Umm…. I just LOVE men with a sense of duty. Let me stay here 
with you." 
"Uhh….. Help! My strange and wonderful little place." 
"Doh! And this was supposed to be my last job! Do something!!" "I never thought this would ever happen to me! Great….. I'm 
quitting tomorrow!" 
"Uh oh….. There goes the pillar." "I'm scared, but it's for you own good." : "If things get too hairy, we'll escape. It's not something you'll 
see happen very often." 
Aerith: "Don't worry, you let me handle this."  


  
Sector 7 Falls -
(Cloud and Tifa climb the flights of stairs up the side of the tower. 
Along the way, they meet Biggs, who is leaning over the railing, wounded.) 
Biggs: "Cloud… so you don't care… what happens… to the…. Planet?" 
Nope, not interested: You're wounded….. 
Cloud: Nope, not interested 
Biggs: "Hmph…. you haven't changed. Oh, forget it." 
Cloud: You're wounded….. 
Biggs: "Thanks, Cloud." "…don't worry 'bout me…. Barret's… fighting up there. Go 
help him…." 

(Continuing up the tower, they meet Jessie, who is lying on the stairs, 
also hurt.) 
Jessie: "….Cloud… I'm glad…. I could talk with you one last time." 
Don't say 'last'……. Is that so….. 
Cloud: Don't say 'last'…… 
Jessie: "That's…. all right……" "Because of our actions… many……. people died…… this 
probably…. is our punishment….." 
Cloud: Is that so…. 
Jessie: "…Is.. that so……?" "Ha…… cool…… as usual… ex-SOLDIER. …always… I liked 
that…. in you…." 

(Reaching the top of the tower, they meet Barret, who is fighting the 
numberous Shinra enemies.) 
Barret: "Tifa! Cloud! You came!" "Be careful! They're attacking
from the helicopter." 
Tifa: "Better equip ourselves before
they attack in full force!" 
 
Tifa: "Here they come!" 
(A helicopter flies past, and Reno drops from it. He runs over to a 
mechanism on the side of the pillar and presses a few buttons on it. 
Cloud, Barret, and Tifa run over.) 
Reno: "You're too late. Once I push this button…" 
 
Reno: "That's all, folks! Mission accomplished." 
Tifa: "We have to disarm it! Cloud! Barret! Please!" 
Reno: "I can't have you do that. No one gets in the way of Reno and the 
Turks…" 
 
Reno: "It's time." 
(Reno jumps off the edge of the tower. Tifa runs over to the mechanism and 
tries to disarm the bomb.) 
Tifa: "Cloud! I don't know how to stop this! Try it!" 
 
Cloud: "It's not a normal time bomb." 
(The helicopter hovers up to the side of the tower. A Turk, Tseng, pops 
his head out the side window.) 
Tseng: "That's right. You'll have a hard time disarming that one." "It'll blow the second some stupid jerk touches it." 
Tifa: "Please, stop it!" 
Tseng: "Ha ha ha….." "Only a Shinra Executive can set up or disarm the Emergency Plate 
Release System." 
Barret: "Shut yer hole!" 
 
Tseng: "I wouldn't try that…. You just might make me injure our 
special guest." 
 
Tifa: "Aerith!!" 
Tseng: "Oh, you know each other?" "How nice you could see each other one last time. You should 
thank me." 
Cloud: "What are you gonna do with Aerith?" 
Tseng: "I haven't decided." "Our orders were to find and catch the last remaining Ancient." "It's taken us a long time, but now I can finally report this to 
the President." 
 
Aerith: "Tifa, don't worry! She's all right!" 
 
Tifa: "Aerith!" 
 
Aerith: "Hurry and get out!" 
Tseng: "Ha, ha, ha… Well, it should be starting right about now. Think 
you can escape in time?" 
(FMV sequence. The helicopter flies away, and the pillar begins to 
explode, sending chunks of flaming steel and concrete falling to the 
ground.) 
Tifa: "Once that plate starts coming
down it's too late. We gotta hurry!" 
 
Barret: "Yo, we can use this wire to get out!"

(Tifa climbs in Barret's lap. Cloud climbs up on his shoulders. FMV 
sequence. The pillar explodes. The people in the slums panic as the upper 
plate comes crashing down to crush their homes. Cloud, Tifa, and Barret 
swing on the wire and barely escape the falling plate as President Shinra 
watches it all from his office window in Shinra HQ, opera music blaring 
from the stereo.)  




  
Biggs… Wedge… Jessie… …Marlene… -
(Cloud, Tifa, and Barret come to in the playground. Everything has been 
demolished; shards of debris protrude grotesquely from the happy face of 
the children's slide; steam rises from the ground in several places. 
Barret runs over to the pile of debris that was the gate to Sector 7.) 
Barret: "Marlene!!" "MAR---LE---NE!!" 
 
Barret: "Biggs!" 
 
Barret: "Wedge!!" 
 
Barret: "Jessie!" 
 
Barret: "GOD DAMN IT!!" "DAMMIT!!" "DAMMIT ALL TO HELL!!" 
 
Barret: "What the hell's it all for!?" "ARGGHHHH!!!" 
Cloud: "Hey, Barret!" 
Tifa: "Barret!" 
Barret: "ARGGHHHH!!!" 
 
Cloud: "Hey!" 
Tifa: "Barret, stop… Please stop, Barret." 
Barret: "URGHHHH!!!" 
(He fires on the pile of debris, sweeping it with bullets… then stops, 
and falls to his knees.) 
Barret: "God damn…" 
  
(The  fades back in. Barret is sitting on the end of the slide. Cloud 
and Tifa stand nearby.) 
Barret: "Marlene…" 
Tifa: "……. Barret……?" "Marlene is…. I think Marlene is safe." 
 
Barret: "….huh?" 
Tifa: "Right before they took Aerith, she said, 'Don't worry, she's all 
right.' She was probably talking about Marlene." 
 
Barret: "R, really!?" 
Tifa: "But…" 
Barret: "Biggs…… Wedge…. Jessie……" 
Cloud: "All three of them were in the pillar." 
Barret: "Think I don't know that?" 
 
Barret: "But… we, all of us fought together." 
 
Barret: "I don't wanna think of them as dead!" 
Tifa: "And the other people in Sector 7." 
Barret: "This is all screwed up!" "They destroyed an entire village just to get to us! They killed 
so many people…." 
Tifa: "…are you saying it's our fault? Because AVALANCHE was here? I
nnocent people lost their lives because of us?" 
 
Barret: "No, Tifa!" "That ain't it! Hell no!!" "It ain't us! It's the damn Shinra! It's never been nobody but 
the Shinra!" 
(Cloud steps back, facing away from Barret and Tifa. Barret faces away 
and raises his arms.) 
Barret: "They're evil and destroyin' our planet just to…" "build their power and line their own damn pockets with gold!" "If we don't get rid of them, they're gonna kill this planet!" 
 
Barret: "Our fight ain't never gonna be over until we get rid of them!" 
 
Tifa: "…………I don't know." 
Barret: "What don't you know!? You don't believe me?" 
Tifa: "It's not that. I'm not sure about … me. My feelings." 
 
Barret: "An' what about you?" 
 
Cloud: "……….." 
 
Barret: "Yo!" "Where's he think he's goin'?" 
Tifa: "Oh! Aerith!" 
Barret: "Oh yeah, that girl. What's up with her?" 
Tifa: "…I don't really know… But she's the one I left Marlene 
with." 
Barret: "Damn! Marlene!!" 
 
Barret: "Tifa. There ain't no turnin' back now." 
(He exits. Tifa heads for the exit, stops and looks back over her 
shoulder… then exits. The  fades.) 
(The  fades back in. Cloud is walking along the broken highway, away 
from the playground.) 
"Cloud!" 
 
Barret: "Take me to Marlene!" 
Tifa: "You're going to help Aerith?" 
Cloud: "Yeah…. But before that, there's something I want to know." 
Tifa: "What's that?" 
 
Cloud: "It's about the Ancients." 
(The screen flashes white, as if lightning were striking, then goes 
completely black.) 
In my veins courses the blood of the Ancients. I am one of the 
rightful heirs to this planet! 
(The screen goes white again… then we are back at the broken highway. 
Cloud looks down.) 
Cloud: "Sephiroth…?" 
 
Tifa: "Are you all right?" 
Barret: "Pull it together, man!" 
 




  
The Flower Girl Origins -
(Cloud, Barret, and Tifa arrive at Aerith's house. Aerith's mother, 
Elmyra, is standing, facing the wall. They walk over to her.) 
Elmyra: "Cloud…… wasn't it?" 
 
Elmyra: "It's about Aerith, isn't it?" 
 
Cloud: "…Sorry. The Shinra have her." 
Elmyra: "I know. They took her from here." 
Cloud: "They were here?" 
Elmyra: "That's what Aerith wanted…" 
Cloud: "Why is Shinra after Aerith?" 
 
Elmyra: "Aerith is an Ancient. The sole survivor." 
Barret: "…What did you say? But, aren't you her mother?" 
Elmyra: "…Not her real mother. Oh… it must have been 15 years ago…" "…during the war. My husband was sent to the front. Some far 
away place called Wutai." 
(The camera pans up… Aerith's house disappears off the bottom of the 
screen, leaving only black.) 
"One day, I went to the station because I got a letter saying he 
was coming home on leave." 
(The screen goes white. A train whistle blows, and we see the Sector 7 
train station. A train is pulling into the station. The door opens, and 
bright light fills the screen. We see various people getting off, greeted 
by their families… Elmyra stands near, watching the people getting 
off… Then the train door closes. She walks, afraid, to the conductor, 
who shakes his head. She sits forlornly on the steps to the platform.) 
My husband never came back. I wonder if something happened to him? No, I'm sure his leave was just canceled. I went to the station everyday. Then, one day………. 
(The screen goes white… then we see a woman lying on the steps to the 
platform. A young girl is running around her, crying. Elmyra runs over 
and kneels by the woman. The young girl runs to her.) 
You used to see this sort of thing a lot during the war. Her last words were, "Please take Aerith somewhere safe." My husband never came back. I had no child. I was probably 
lonely. So I decided to take her home with me. 
 
"Aerith and I became close very quickly. That child loved to 
talk. She used to talk to me about everything." 
(We are back at the living room, but some time past. Aerith as a young 
girl runs down the stairs, then trips on the rug. Elmyra rises from the 
table, helps her up, hugs her, then Aerith scampers out the front door. 
The living room disappears off the top of the screen.) 
"She told me she escaped form some sort of research laboratory 
somewhere. And that her mother had already returned to the planet, so she 
wasn't lonely… and many other things." 
 
Barret: "Returned to the planet?" 
Elmyra: "I didn't know what she meant. I asked if she meant a star in the 
sky." "But she said it was this planet… She was a mysterious child 
in many ways." 
Aerith: "Mom." 
(Elmyra turns toward the stairs. The camera pans up, hiding Cloud and the 
others, then pans down again and they are gone. Aerith, as a young girl, 
runs down the stairs. Elmyra is speaking in the present.) 
Aerith: "Please don't cry." 
Elmyra: "Aerith just blurted that out all of a sudden. When I asked her 
if something had happened…" 
Aerith: "Someone dear to you has just died." "His spirit was coming to see you, but he already returned to 
the planet." 
Elmyra: "At that time I didn't believe her." 
 
Elmyra: "But…" 
(It comes back, from the left. Elmyra is sitting at the table, holding 
her head in her hands. Her shoulders are hitching.) 
Elmyra: "Several days later… We received a notice saying my husband 
had died…" 
 
Elmyra: "…and that's how it was." "A lot had happened, but we were happy. Until one day…" 
(The living room reappears from the left. Tseng is in the living room with 
Elmyra.) 
Tseng: "We want you to return Aerith to us. We've been saerching for 
her for a long time." 
 
Aerith: "No! Never!" 
Tseng: "Aerith, you're a very special child. You are of special blood." "Your real mother was an 'Ancient'." 
Elmyra: "Of course I heard it. That she was an Ancient." 
Tseng: "The Ancients will lead us to a land of supreme happiness." "Aerith will be able to bring happiness to all those in the 
slums." "That is why Shinra would like Aerith's cooperation……." 
 
Aerith: "He's wrong! I'm not an Ancient! I'm not!" 
Tseng: "But Aerith, surely you hear voices
sometimes when you're all alone?" 
Aerith: "No, I don't!" 
(Aerith runs out the front door. The
living room disappears off the top right.) 
Elmyra: "But I knew. I knew about her
mysterious powers…" "She tried so hard to hide it, so I
acted as though I never noticed." 
(The living room, seen from the top down, comes back into view from the 
top.) 
Cloud: "It's amazing how she's avoided the Shinra for all these years…" 
Elmyra: "The Shinra needed her. So I guess they wouldn't harm her." 
Tifa: "But, why now….." 
Elmyra: "She brought a little girl here with her." "On the way here, Tseng found them. She probably couldn't get 
away fast enough." "She decided to go to the Shinra in exchange for the little 
girl's safety." 
Cloud: "Must be Marlene." 
Barret: "Marlene!! Aerith was caught because of Marlene!?" "I'm sorry. Marlene's my daughter. I'm …really… sorry…" 
Elmyra: "You're her father!? How in the world could you ever leave a 
child alone like that!?" 
Barret: "…please don't start with that. I think about it all the time. 
What would happen to Marlene, if I…" "But you gotta understand somethin'… …I don't got an answer. 
I wanna be with Marlene… But I gotta fight." "'Cause if I don't… the planet's gonna die." "So I'm gonna keep fightin'!" "But, I'm worried 'bout Marlene. I really just wanna be with 
her… always." "See? I'm goin' in circles, now." 
Elmyra: "I think I understand what you're saying… She's upstairs 
asleep. Why don't you go and see her." 
 
Tifa: "It's my fault… I was the one who got Aerith involved in this." 
Elmyra: "Don't say that. Aerith doesn't think that." 
(Cloud goes upstairs, into the bedroom, where Barret is sitting with 
Marlene.) 
Barret: "I'm so glad……. I'm so glad you're all right…" 
Marlene: "Daddy, don't cry. Your whiskers hurt!" 
 
Barret: "Cloud!" 
 
Barret: "You gonna go help Aerith, right? She's done so much for me…." "If it's the Shinra you're dealin' with, I can't just sit here! 
I'm comin', too!" 
 
Marlene: "Guess what? Guess what? Aerith was asking me lots of questions." "Like what kind of person Cloud is. I bet she likes you, Cloud!" 
I don't know: Let's hope so 
Cloud: I don't know 
Marlene: "Stupid!" 
Cloud: Let's hope so 
Marlene: "I won't tell Tifa." 

 
Tifa: "You're going after Aerith, right?" 
Cloud: "Yeah." 
Tifa: "I'm going with you." 
Cloud: "We're going right into Shinra headquarters. …You gotta be 
prepared for the worst." 
Tifa: "I know." "Right now, I feel I have to push myself to the limit." "If I stayed here… I'll go crazy." 
 
Barret: "Sorry, but can you take care of Marlene a bit longer?" 
Elmyra: "Yes, I don't mind." 
Barret: "This place is dangerous now. You better go somewhere else." 
Elmyra  
"…You're right. But promise me that you'll come back to her. Don't get 
yourself killed." 
 
Tifa: "How do we get to the Shinra Building?" 
Barret: "There ain't no train that goes up there anymore…" "….." "Well, let's just go to Wall Market. We might be able to find 
something there." 




  
A Golden Shiny Wire Of Hope -
(Cloud, Tifa, and Barret go to Wall Market. They go to the Weapon Shop and 
speak to the old man there.) 
"You goin' up to the plate? You better have a battery." 
Cloud: "You're gonna sell me something you just found?" 
"Hey, you knew? But I repaired it, so it's all right." 
Cloud: "Why do I need a battery to climb up to the plate?" 
"You'll find out when you get there. How 'bout 100 Gil for 
each?" 
Cloud: "……." 
Cloud: All right, I'll take them 
 
(They continue north. When they reach the Don's mansion, they see two 
children.) 
"Wanna see something awesome? Follow me!" 
(They follow the children to a large wall. A small girl is sitting at the 
base. There is a power line running up the wall.) 
"Everyone climbed up this wire. Looks scary…. Brr." 
Tifa: "Can we climb it?" 
"Yeah. It leads to the Upper World." 
Barret: "Awright! We'll climb this wire!" 
Cloud: "There's no way we can do this. You know how far it goes up?" 
Barret: "There IS a way! Look! What's that look like?" 
Cloud: "Just a normal wire." 
Barret: "Oh yeah? Well to me it looks like a golden shiny wire of hope." 
 
Tifa: "You're right. This is the only way to save Aerith…" 
Cloud: "Ok, that was a bad analogy, but, Barret, I understand how you 
feel." "Let's go!" 
(They climb the wire….. and climb….. and climb…. when they reach 
the top of the wall they see the two children from earlier, sitting on 
the top.) 
"Oh man! This is horrible…" 
"Hey, scary, huh? Dad told me that it's the Shinra's doing." 
(They climb some more… scaling power lines, broken propellers, and 
pieces of debris, until they reach the top. The Shinra Building.) 




  
140 Flights… -
 
Barret: "Hey, you oughta know this building well." 
Cloud: "……Not really, now that I think about it." "This's the first time I've ever been to the Headquarters." 
Barret: "I heard about this place before." "Every floor above the 60th is special and not easy to get to 
even for employees." "Must be where they took Aerith." "The security's pretty light now. Awright, let's go!!" 
 
Tifa: "Wait a second! You're not thinking of just going right through 
the main entrance, are you?" 
Barret: "Well what else does it look like!? I'm gonna kick some Shinra 
butt and……." 
Tifa: "That's not going to work! We've got to find another way…." 
Baret: "Ain't gonna be no other way! If we keep wastin' time like this, 
Aerith'll….." 
Tifa: "I know that! But if we get caught here…." "Hey, Cloud. …What should we do?" 
Let's bust on in! Let's sneak in quietly 
Cloud: Let's bust on in 
Barret: "That's more like it! C'mon, let's go!!" 
 
Receptionist: "Excuse me! If you don't have an appointment, you'll just have 
to…" 
Barret: "Don't need no appointment… This is a 'mergency!" "Anyone who don't wanna get their face bashed in better git outta 
the way!!" 
"Yaagghh!" 
"Who do they think they are?" 
"Hey, you don't think that's AVALANCHE?" 
"Intruders! Sieze them!!" 
 
Barret: "Let's go to the top!" 
Cloud: Let's sneak in quietly 
Tifa: "See? Let's be careful and find a different route!" 
(They go down a side alley and go through a door. Inside, they find… 
stairs…. Lots of them…. They start climbing.) 
Barret: "Yo… You really gonna take these stairs all the way up?" 
Tifa: "Well we've got to get to Aerith to help her somehow." 
Barret: "Talk about out of the way…" 
Tifa: "I don't have time to argue with you! I'm going!" 
Barret: "Y, yo, Tifa! Don't go off alone!" 
(They continue to climb… and climb…. They are climbing stairs 
throughout this whole conversation.) 
Barret: "Don't know… why the hell… we gotta climb…" 
Cloud: "…because we don't want to start a commotion until we've saved 
Aerith." "I doubt that's possible though…" 
Barret: "…heh heh heh." 
Cloud: "Knock it off. You're giving me the creeps." 
Barret: "So even you will fight for someone else. I had you figured 
wrong I guess." 
Cloud: "Who cares what you figured!" 
Barret: "I'm just sayin' mebbe I was wrong…" 
Tifa: "Heh heh heh……." 
Cloud: "What's that supposed to mean, Tifa?" 
Barret: "How much farther do these stairs go on?" 
Tifa: "Why don't you ask them?" 
Barret: "It's not one of them endless stairways or somethin', d'ya 
think?" 
Tifa: "Of course not!!" 
Barret: "Right… couldn't be that…." 
Barret: "Are we there yet?" 
Tifa: "Not yet." 
Barret: "…there yet?" 
Tifa: "I said not yet!" 
Barret: "Yo…" 
Tifa: "Look, don't even ask! We're way way way way far away from being 
there, ok!?" 
Barret: "Damn, man! I've had it! I'm going back!" 
Tifa: "And take just as long going down as you did coming up?" 
Barret: "…………." 
 
Tifa: "C'mon, Barret. Pull it together!" 
Barret: "Yeah, well all I know is I'm just flesh 'n' blood…. 'cept 
for this arm of mine." "Don't treat me like I'm some ex-member of SOLDIER or 
somethin'…….." 
Tifa: "What about me!? I'm human too! Oh, do what you want, I'm 
going on!" 
 
Tifa: "……?" "Yaah! Barret! You go first!" 
Barret: "What're ya ignorant? I didn't mean that…" 
Tifa: "All right, all right!" 
 
Tifa: "Cloud, you go on ahead too!!" 
 
Barret: "Yo… What floor is this?" 
Tifa: "…I gave up counting." 
Barret: "Why they gotta build these buildings so damn tall?" "That Shinra…. They're just no damn good." 
Tifa: "………" 
Barret: "huff…. Man, I'm beat…" "Marlene, Daddy wanted to see your face one more time…" 
Tifa: "Would you stop acting like a retard and climb?" "It's just a bit more!" "…maybe." 
 
Barret: "F… finally… M… made it…" "N… never wanna see… no more stairs the rest of my life…" 
Tifa: "huff… puff… this really takes it out of you…" "But this is it. We'd better get ready…!" 
 

  
Climbing Shinra Tower -
(Cloud, Tifa, and Barret reach the 59th floor of the Shinra building. 
Three guards see them.) 
"Destroy the intruders!" 
 
 
Cloud: "What's this?" 
(He stoops and picks up the Keycard 60. They enter the elevator to the 
60th floor.) 
Barret: "This is the real thing. Don't let your guard down." 
Tifa: "I hope Aerith is all right." 
(FMV sequence of a guard asleep at the surveillance system. They exit the 
elevator onto the 60th floor. They see two guards.) 
"People like you don't belong here! Go on, get out!" "What're you doing here!? No unauthorized people are allowed 
here!!" 
 
Barret: "Lookit that, all them guards is runnin' around." "Cloud, you go on ahead and signal us when it's safe to come." 
(The guards are patrolling behind a row of statues, for some reason. 
Cloud hides behind each statue, moving forward when the guards look away. 
He signals the others to follow. The PLAYER controls this. If they are 
spotted, they fight a battle and start over. They make their way past the 
guards.) 
Barret: "Ok! We gonna rock!" 
Tifa: "Remember, we're here to save Aerith." 
Barret: "Hell, I know that!" 
 
People on the 61st floor 
"What's keeping her? Did she forget her keycard?" "Even employees can't walk around above the 60th floor without a 
keycard.." 
"This is the lounge floor. Above us are the special floors for 
the big wigs in the company." "It's tough working under someone. Tires you out." 
"I thought I heard a ruckus downstairs a minute ago. Do you know 
what that was all about?" 
"No idea. But no need to worry because everything above the 60th 
floor is safe." 
"The hell are you? What're you doin' around here?" 
Where's Aerith? ………. 
Cloud: Where's Aerith? 
"Aerith? How did you know that name? You must be…!?" "Aerith, you mean that kid. The receptionist. Yeah, I was 
startin' to worry 'bout her myself." "And so another rival appears on the scene, eh?" "You mean, she's not? It's someone else?" 
Cloud: ………. 
"Oh, I see. So you must be the whatcha call it…" "Shinra, Inc. Repair Division!!" "You know, it looks like this building is starting to fall apart." "This door was just pushed open. You ought to fix this right 
away." "Oh yeah, and take a look on the other floors too. I'll give 
you this." 
 

"I don't remember seeing your face here. You new here?" "Say, you're cute. Let me teach you some… things." 
Things? Um, I'm kinda in a hurry… 
Cloud: Things? 
"Wipe that stupid look off your face. I was only going to teach 
you how to get to the next floor." "The higher ups in the company use the floors above the 60th 
floor. But you can't get there without a keycard." "Get a keycard and you can use the elevators freely." 
*ding* 
"…voila! You hear that sound and the door opens." "Just remember there are different types of cards. One keycard 
won't let you go everywhere." "For example, "'Keycard 60' only takes you to the 60th floor. 'Keycard 65' 
only takes you to the 65th floor." "It's a security system worthy of Shinra. After all, all the 
power in Midgar and the world, for that matter, is controlled by them." "Oh, I have to go. Gotta get back to work!" 
Cloud: Um, I'm kinda in a hurry… 
"Oh? That's too bad…" 
(They go up to the 62nd floor. It's the Mayor's floor. There are four 
rooms, full of bookshelves. Standing outside the Mayor's office is Hart.) 
Hart: "How do you do?" "This is the Midgar Mayor's Office. Mayor Domino is in his 
office." "I am the Deputy Mayor. If you should have any questions feel 
free to ask me…" 
 
Domino: "Hmm? Oh, and who might you be?" "You all must be those… ahem…. Me? I'm Domino, the Mayor of 
Midgar." "Actually, I'm Mayor in name only. The city and everything in it 
is really run by Shinra, Inc." "My only real job is watching over Shinra's documents…" "Me! The Mayor! A librarian! Ohh……." "You want to get upstairs? I tell you what, if you can guess the 
password, I'll give you my keycard." "Yes, that's it. Guess the password and I'll give you my 
keycard!" "Get it on the first try and I'll even throw in a special item!" 
 
Hart: "Did you speak with the Mayor?" "What? A password? Oh, I get it…" "He's got way too much time on his hands. But you can't really 
blame him. Everything in Midgar is controlled by President Shinra." "Maybe I can help you." 
(Hart will offer help in the puzzle, but it costs money. You won't need 
it, since I'm going to tell you how to solve it!) 
[To solve the puzzle:: Look on the nameplates outside each of the four rooms. They will 
tell you what the subject of the rooms are. Enter the room and search the bookshelves until you find a book 
whose title does not match the subject of the room. Look at the number of the book you chose. Now, take the letter of 
the title corresponding to that number. That is, if the number was 3, you 
would take the third letter. Now, look at the four letters from the four rooms, and anagram 
them until they match one of the Mayor's passwords. That's it! If you got it on the first try, you will recieve an 
Elemental Materia.] 
Domino: "Got it?" "Then tell me." 
(Cloud tells him the password. This time it was BEST, your results may 
vary it's random each time, so don't just choose BEST.) 
Domino: "BEST!!" "God, I love the sound of that! BEST!! I AM the best….. ME!! No 
matter what anyone else says, you'd better believe it." "……hmm. Well, ok. Here, take it." 
 
Domino: "I never thought you'd get it on the first try…" "Just goes to show you can't judge a book by its cover. Oh well, 
a promise is a promise. Take this, too." 
 
Domino: "Why would I do something like this, you ask?" "To mess with them, of course! Shinra's been torturing me 
forever." "That's why I was a little rough on you all just now. Now go up 
there and really make them suffer." "This ought to make us even! Heh heh heh….." 
(They go to the 63rd floor, a maze of doors and ventilation pipes. They go 
to a computer terminal in the corner.) 
"… beep….beep…. ……verifying key card….. 
……………….." "Level B employee: verified. You are permitted to open doors on 
this floor up to three times." "blip… If you receive an item coupon, remember to exchange it 
for an item." "…warning… refrain from entering the air conditioning ducts 
recklessly they are very dangerous." 
(They mess around with the doors awhile and enter the ducts, of course, 
until they get the three item coupons. They go back to the terminal.) 
"…bing… bing… Enter command" 
All clear : Coupon Change 
Cloud: Coupon Change 
"You can exchange your coupons for items. Here are the items you 
can have…" "A coupon…..'Star Pendant': B coupon…….'Four Slots': C coupon…….'All Materia'" "Please use caution… once you have exchanged coupons for items 
you may not use 'All Clear' function." "Exchange coupon?" 
Yeah……. Naw 
Cloud: Yeah 
"………………… Coupon exchange complete." 
 


 
People on the 64th floor 
"…huff…puff… If you're tired, you should get some rest in 
the next room." 
"…huff…wheeze… I'm starting to worry about my belly….." 
"Hmph, hmph… Since I'm head of security for this building, 
stamina's very important to me." 
"You must be a visitor. Please feel free to use any unused 
machines." 
"…zzz… Please… let me…. get some….. rest……" 
[vending machine]: "Take one to restore your energy!! 'Shinra Gym Special Drink'" "Only 250 gil!!" 
Try it out: Don't try it 
Cloud: Try it out 
 
Cloud: "…Nothing…" 
Cloud: Don't try it 

[after putting in money]: "……." 
Cloud: "Is it broken?'" 
BANG on it: Give up 
Cloud: BANG on it 
 
"Sir, what are you doing!? No violence here, please!" 
Cloud: Give up 

[treadmill] 
Cloud: "…….." 
Should I try it? This is so stupid 
Cloud: Should I try it? 
 
Cloud: This is so stupid 

[a locker] 
Cloud: "What is this….. a Megaphone?" "Hanging on to this won't do any
good…" 
(They go to the 65th floor, where they solve a tedious puzzle. There are 
several treasure chests, but only one is open. You must find the unlocked 
one, get the Midgar Piece from it, and place it in a hole in a large model 
of Midgar. You are being attacked the whole time. If you want the chest 
sequence, it's 2nd from top on left, 3rd from top on left, top right 
corner, top left, bottom left. The Keycard 66 is in the chest by the 
stairs. Cloud examines the model at the far left, where Sector 6 would be.) 
Cloud: "Midgar…. born from Mako energy which was sucked right out of 
the earth. A model of the city…." "When construction of Sector 6 finishes, Shinra's plan will be 
complete." "That must be why he took Aerith…." 
 
"Whew, I'm so sick of carrying all these files." "But I get to meet lots of guys. I guess that's the benefit of 
being a secretary!" 
People on the 66th floor 
"……………………. ……………………. ……………………. ……………………. ……………………. ……………………. "Phew!" 
"Is it just me or does the Conference Room smell? There's some 
sort of stench coming from somewhere…." 
"Hey, when you're in the bathroom, do you ever hear whispers 
coming from somewhere?" 
"They're having another executive meeting. I wonder if it's about 
that Plate incident." 
"It gives me the feeling that I AM alive. The feeling of moving 
this world, just with my hands." 
"Come on, we're building the future of Mako!" 
 
Flush? Climb up? Get out of here 
Cloud: Flush 
 
Cloud: Climb up? 
(They climb up into the ventilation duct above the toilet. It leads to 
above the Conference Room, which would explain the smell in there.) 
Cloud: Get out of here 
 

[In the duct above the Conference Room…..] 
(They crouch above the vent. Through the slats, they see President Shinra 
and other employees sitting at a long table in the Conference Room.) 
Barret: "Geez--! That's a lotta suits!" 
 
Reeve: "We have the damage estimates for Sector 7." "Considering those factories we already set up and all the 
investments, the damage is estimated at approximately 10 Billion gil…" 
 
Reeve: "The estimated cost to rebuild Sector 7 is…" 
President Shinra: "We're not rebuilding." 
Reeve: "What?" 
President Shinra: "We're leaving Sector 7 as it is." "And restarting the Neo-Midgar plan." 
Reeve: "…then the Ancients?" 
President Shinra: "The Promised Land will soon be ours." "I want you to raise the Mako rates 15% in every area." 
 
Palmer: "Rate hike! Rate hike! Tra, la, la! And please include our Space 
Program in the budget!" 
President Shinra: "Reeve and Scarlet will divide the extra income from the rate 
increase." 
 
Palmer: "Oh man!" 
 
Reeve: "Sir, if you raise the rates, the people will lose confidence…" 
President Shinra: "It'll be all right." "The ignorant citizens won't lose confidence, they'll trust 
Shinra, Inc. even more." 
Heidegger: "Ha ha ha!" "After all, we're the ones who saved Sector 7 from AVALANCHE!" 
Barret: "That dirty #$*$^" 
(We are looking at the table head-on again. Hojo enters the Conference 
Room.) 
President Shinra: "Hojo. How's the girl?" 
 
Hojo: "As a specimen, she is inferior to her mother. I'm still in the 
process of comparing her to her mother, Ifalna, but for now the difference 
is 18%." 
President Shinra: "How long will the research take?"
Hojo: "Probably 120 years. It's probably impossible to finish in our 
lifetime. Or in the lifetime of the specimen too, for that matter." 
 
Hojo: "That's why we're thinking of breeding her. Then we could create 
one that would withstand our research for a long time." 
President Shinra: "What about the Promised Land? Won't it hinder our plans?" 
Hojo: "That's what I need to plan. The mother is strong… and yet has 
her weaknesses." 
 
President Shinra: "That concludes our meeting." 
 
Scarlet: "Something stinks…" 
 
Cloud: "They were talking about Aerith… right?" 
Barret: "I dunno." 
Tifa: "Probably." 
Cloud: "Let's follow 'em." 
(They exit the duct and land back on the toilet. They exit the bathroom 
and come around a corner. They spot Hojo.) 
Cloud: "Hojo… huh…?" 
 




  
Specimen Jenova -
(Cloud, Tifa, and Barret follow Hojo to the 67th floor of the Shinra 
building.) 
Barret: "I remember him." "That Hojo guy. He's in charge of the Shinra's Science 
Department. Cloud, don't you know him?" 
Cloud: "This is the first time I've actually ever seen him. So… 
that's what he looks like…" 
(They follow Hojo to a dreary laboratory. A red, lionlike creature is 
imprisoned in a glass tube, sitting apathetically in the far corner. 
They hide behind a crate, just in time to avoid an employee who enters 
the room.) 
"Is this today's specimen?" 
Hojo: "Yes. We're starting right away. Raise it to the upper level." 
 
Hojo: "My precious specimen…" 
(He stands there for a while, then exits. Cloud, Tifa, and Barret come 
out of hiding. Tifa goes to the creature.) 
Tifa: "Precious specimen…?" "Is it going to be used for a biological experiment?" 
(Cloud turns. He sees a metal dome, with a single door. There is a 
window in the door, through which shines bright purple light.) 
Cloud: "Jenova…"
(He peers into the window and sees a strange, white, female being. Her 
head has apparently been removed rather violently. Cloud backs away and 
clutches his head. A high-pitched whine reverberates through the room, or 
perhaps only Cloud's head, and he collapses to the floor. Tifa and Barret 
run over.) 
Cloud: "Jenova… Sephiroth's… So… they've brought it here." 
Tifa: "Cloud, be strong!" 
Cloud: "Did you see it?" 
Barret: "See what?" 
Cloud: "It's moving…….. still alive?" 
 
Barret: "Where's its $#&*&@ head? This whole thing's stupid. Let's keep 
goin'." 
(Cloud gets up. They continue, futher into the lab, reaching an elevator. 
They enter and climb to the 68th floor.) 




  
Experimental Aerith -
(Cloud, Barret, and Tifa arrive on the 68th floor. It is a research lab, 
more advanced than that on the 67th floor. There is a glass tube like 
that on the 67th. Near the glass tube is Hojo. Inside the glass tube is 
Aerith.) 
Cloud: "Aerith!" 
Hojo: "Aerith? Oh, is that her name? What do you want?" 
Cloud: "We're taking Aerith back." 
Hojo: "Outsiders….." 
Barret: "Shoulda noticed it earlier, you…" 
Hojo: "There's so many frivolous things in this world." 
 
Hojo: "Are you going to kill me? I don't think you should." "The equipment here is extremely delicate. Without me, who could 
operate it? Hmm?" 
Cloud: "Ugh." 
Hojo: "That's right. I recommend you think things out logically before 
you make any rash moves." "Now, bring in the Specimen!" 
(The red creature from the 67th floor is lifted into the tube. Cloud, 
Barret, and Tifa run to the tube. The creature twitches its tail. Aerith 
runs to the glass.) 
Aerith: "Cloud, help!" 
 
Cloud: "What do you think you're doin'?" 
Hojo: "Lending a helping hand to an endangered species… Both of them 
are on the brink of extinction…" "If I don't help, all these animals will disappear." 
Tifa: "…animal? That's terrible! Aerith is a human being!" 
Barret: "You're gonna pay!" 
Cloud: "Barret! Can't you do anything?" 
 
Barret: "Awright!! Step back!" 
Hojo: "Stop!" 
(Barret fires at the tube. The inside of the tube glows a brilliant white 
as it malfunctions. Hojo runs to the tube.) 
Hojo: "Wh… what are you do- Oh! My precious specimens…" 
(The tube glows brighter. The door opens… the light dims, and we see the 
red creature poised in the door. It leaps forward and starts attacking 
Hojo.) 
Cloud: "Now's our chance to get Aerith!" 
 
Aerith: "Thanks, Cloud." 
(She runs out of the tube, which starts to glow a dull blue. Cloud backs 
out of the tube.) 
Tifa: "Cloud… what's wrong?" 
Cloud: "…The elevator is moving." 
 
Hojo: "This is no ordinary specimen. This is a very ferocious specimen!" 
 
"He's rather strong. I'll help you all out." 
Tifa: "It talked!?" 
"I'll talk as much as you want later, Miss." 
 
Cloud: "We'll take care of that monster." "Somebody take Aerith somewhere safe…" 
Tifa, I'm countin' on you! Barret, take care of her! 
Cloud: Tifa, I'm countin' on you! 
 
Cloud: Barret, take care of her! 
 

Cloud: "What's your name?" 
Red: "Hojo has named me, Red XIII. A name with no meaning whatsoever 
to me. Call me whatever you wish." 
 
Cloud: "Come on!" 
 
 
Cloud: "Aerith, you all right?" 
Tifa: "She seems all right, …in many ways." 
Red XIII: "I have a right to choose, too. I don't like two-legged things." 
Barret: "What are you?" 
Red XIII: "An informed question. But difficult to answer. I am what you 
see." "…You must have many questions, but first, let's get out of 
here. I'll lead the way." 
Aerith: "Cloud… so you did come for me." 
 
Red XIII: "I apologize for what happened back there. I was merely acting to 
throw Hojo off guard……" 
Barret: "Now we've saved Aerith, ain't no need to be in this buildin'! So 
let's get the hell outta here!" 
Cloud: "If all five of us go together, we'll be noticed. Let's break up 
into two groups." 
 
Aerith: "I'll see you later!! We'll be waiting at the 66th Floor 
Elevator." 
Tifa: "We'll be going first! Meet at the 66th Floor Elevator." 
 
"No! Please don't kill me. I only did what Hojo told me to do." "To prove it to you…. here, this is the key card to the 68th 
Floor. Would I be doing this if I was the enemy?" 
(They go to the 66th Floor elevator and operate the switch. A Turk walks 
in and places his hand on Cloud's shoulder…) 
Cloud: "H, hey! What is it?" 
Rude: "Would you press 'Up' please?" 
Cloud: "Turks? Must be a trap…" 
 
Tseng: "It must have been a real thrill for you… Did you enjoy it?" 
Cloud: "Ggh…" 




  
Captured Meet The President -
(Rude and Tseng lead Cloud, Barret, Tifa, and Red XIII into the 
President's office. Their hands and feet are bound.) 
Cloud: "You all got caught, too?" 
 
Cloud: "Where is Aerith!?" 
President Shinra: "In a safe place." 
 
President Shinra: "She's the last surviving Ancient…" "Don't you know? They called themselves the Cetra, and lived 
thousands of years ago. Now they are just a forgotten page in history." 
Red XIII: "Cetra… That girl, is she a survivor of the Cetra?" 
President Shinra: "Cetra, or the Ancients will show us the way to the 'Promised 
Land.' I'm expecting a lot out of her." 
Red XIII: "The Promised Land? Isn't that just a legend?" 
President Shinra: "Even so, it's just too appealing to not to pursue." "It's been said the Promised Land is very fertile." "…If the land is fertile…" 
Barret: "Then there's gotta be Mako!" 
President Shinra: "Exactly. That is why our money sucking Mako Reactor is a 
necessity." "The abundant Mako will just come out on its own." "That is where Neo-Midgar will be built. Shinra's new glory…" 
 
Barret: "@$#^%! Quit dreamin'!" 
President Shinra: "Oh really, don't you know? These days all it takes for your 
dreams to come true is money and science." "Well, that is all for our meeting." 
 
Rude: "Come on! Outta his way!" 
 
Barret: "Hold it! I got a lot I wanna say to you!" 
(He is dragged out, still struggling, by Rude. President Shinra polishes 
his jacket buttons.) 
President Shinra: "If you need something else… talk to my secretary."  
  
A Night In Jail-
(Cloud and the others wake up in the prison cells on the 67th floor. 
Aerith is in her own cell on the left, Barret and Red XIII share the right 
cell, and Tifa is in the cot in Cloud's center cell.) 
Tifa: "Psst " 
 
Cloud:  
Tifa: "Psst " 
Cloud:  
Tifa: "Psst " 

 
I wonder how Barret is doing: I wonder how Red XIII is doing: I wonder how Aerith is doing 
Cloud: I wonder how Barret is doing 
 
Barret: "Hey!" "Aerith is an Ancient and the real name of the Ancients is 
Cetra." "The Ancients know where the Promised Land is and the Shinra is 
searching for that Promised Land." "I only hear stories 'bout the Promised Land. I don't know if it 
really exists." "Is that right?" "The Shinra believe that the Promised Land is full of Mako 
energy." "Which means, if the Shinra get there, they'll suck up all the 
Mako energy." "…and the land'll wither away. The Planet's gonna get weaker." 
 
Barret: "I can't just leave 'em be. I'm recruitin' new members!!" "Me, Tifa, Cloud… and Aerith too." 
 
Barret: "How 'bout you?" 
 
Barret: "You're so damn boring." 
Cloud: I wonder how Red XIII is doing 
Red XIII: "…………Grandpa." 
Barret: "Grandpa!? Ha, ha, ha…… Grandpa, hmm…. ha, ha, ha……." 
 
Red XIII: "What's so funny?" 
Barret: "Nothin'…… ha, ha" 
Cloud: I wonder how Aerith is doing 
 
Aerith: "Cloud, are you there?" 
Cloud: "Aerith!? You safe?" 
Aerith: "Yeah, I'm all right." 
 
Aerith: "I knew that Cloud would come for me." 
Cloud: "Hey, I'm your bodyguard, right?" 
 
Aerith  
"The deal was for one date, right?" 
 
Tifa: "…………oh, I get it." 
Aerith: "…!? Tifa! Tifa, you're there too!" 
Tifa: "EXCUSE me." 
 
Tifa: "You know, Aerith, I have a question." 
Aerith: "What?" 
Tifa: "Does the Promised Land really exist?" 
 
Aerith: "…I don't know." 
 
Aerith: "All I know is…" "The Cetra were born from the Planet, speak with the Planet, and 
unlock the Planet." "And……. then……" "The Cetra will return to the Promised Land. A land that promises 
supreme happiness." 
 
Tifa: "…What does that mean?" 
Aerith: "More than words…… I don't know." 
Cloud: "…Speak with the Planet?" 
 
Tifa: "Just what does the Planet say?" 
Aerith: "It's full of people and noisy. That's why I can't make out what 
they're saying." 
 
Cloud: "You hear it now?" 
Aerith: "I, I only heard it at the Church in the Slums. Mother said 
that Midgar was no longer safe. That is…. my real mother." 
 
Aerith: "Someday I'll get out of Midgar… Speak with the Planet and find 
my Promised Land." "…That's what mom said." "I thought I would stop hearing her voice as I grew up, but…." 

Cloud: Let's just get some sleep 
 




  
Sephiroth Alive!? Rufus' Ascent -
(Cloud wakes up in the middle of the night in his and Tifa's prison cell. 
He sees that the door is open.) 
Cloud: "The door's open… When did it open?" 
(He goes through the door and walks down the hall. There is a guard, 
dead, lying on the floor. He kneels by him) 
Cloud: "What's happened?" 
 
Cloud: "Tifa… Wake up!" 
 
Tifa: "What's wrong?" 
Cloud: "Something's wrong. Look outside." 
 
Tifa: "I wonder what happened…" 
Cloud: "He should have the key on him…" 
 
Cloud: "Come on, Tifa, get Aerith, I'll go help Barret and the others." 
 
Cloud: "Barret, Red XIII… come with me. Something's wrong." 
 
Barret: "How'd you get in? Why's the door open!?" 
 
Barret: "The hell's goin' on!?" 
Red XIII: "No human could've done this." "I'll go on ahead." 
 
Barret: "I'll clean up back here, so you guys go ahead. And don't get 
caught by Shinra!" 
 
Tifa: "Come on, let's follow Red XIII!" 
(They follow Red XIII to the lab where he was previously imprisoned. The 
path there is stained with blood and littered with bodies. Where there 
was a door in the metal dome, there is now a gaping hole.) 
Cloud: "…Did it get away? Jenova…?" 
Red XIII: "Jenova Specimen… Looks like it went to the upper floor using 
that elevator for the specimens." 
 
Red XIII: "It looks like it leads up…" 
(They take the elevator up to the 69th floor., then the stairs up to the 
70th. Barret and Red XIII catch up with the rest. They arrive at President 
Shinra's office. He is seated at his desk. A large sword is protruding
from his back.) 
Barret: "He's dead… The leader of Shinra, Inc. is dead." 
 
Tifa: "Then this sword must be…!?" 
Cloud: "Sephiroth's!!" 
Tifa: "…Sephiroth is alive?" 
Cloud: "…Looks like it. Only Sephiroth can use that sword." 
Barret: "Who cares who did it!? This is the end of the Shinra now!" 
"Uh!" 
(Palmer jumps out from behind the desk and makes a break for it. Cloud 
and Barret catch him by the arms.) 
Palmer: "P, p, p, please, don't kill me!" 
Cloud: "What happened?" 
Palmer: "Se… Sephiroth. Sephiroth came." 
Cloud: "Did you see him? Did you see Sephiroth?" 
Palmer: "Yeah, I saw him!! I saw him with my own eyes!" 
Cloud: "You really saw him?" 
Palmer: "Uh! Would I lie to you at a time like this!? And I heard his 
voice too!" "Um, he was saying something about not letting us have the 
Promised Land." 
Tifa: "Then what?" "Does that mean that the Promised Land really exists and that 
Sephiroth's here to save it from Shinra?" 
Barret: "So he's a good guy then?" 
Cloud: "Save the Promised Land? A good guy? No way!!" "It's not that simple!! I know him! Sephiroth's mission is 
different!" 
(A helicopter hovers into view in the big bay windows. Palmer breaks free 
and flees.) 
Barret: "Rufus! &*%$!! I forgot about him!" 
Tifa: "Who's that?" 
Barret: "Vice President Rufus. The President's son." 
Tifa: "I wonder what kind of person he
is…" 
Aerith: "I've heard that no one's ever seen
him bleed or cry." 
Barret: "I heard that he's been assigned somewhere else for a long 
time…" 
Red XIII: "I only know his name." 
(Cloud runs out onto the balcony at the top of the Shinra Building. The 
rest follow. They find Rufus and Palmer there.) 
Rufus: "So… So Sephiroth was actually here. …By the way." 
 
Rufus: "Who are you guys?" 
 
Cloud: "I'm Cloud, former SOLDIER First Class!" 
Barret: "I'm from AVALANCHE!" 
Tifa: "Same here!" 
Aerith: "…a flower girl from the slums." 
Red XIII: "A research specimen." 
 
Rufus: "What a crew." 
 
Rufus: "Well, I'm Rufus. The President of Shinra, Inc." 
Barret: "You only President, 'cause your old man died!" 
Rufus: "That's right. I'll let you hear my new appointment speech." 
 
Rufus: "…Old man tried to control the world with money. It seems to 
have been working." 
 
Rufus: "The population thought that Shinra would protect them." 
 
Rufus: "Work at Shinra, get your pay. If a terrorist attacks, the Shinra 
army will help you." "It looks perfect on the outside." "But, I do things differently." "I'll control the world with fear. It takes too much to do it 
like my old man." 
 
Rufus: "A little fear will control the minds of the common people. 
There's no reason to waste money on them." 
 
Tifa: "He likes to make speeches just like his father." 
 
Cloud: "Get outta this building with Aerith!" 
Barret: "What?" 
Cloud: "I'll explain later! Barret! This is the real crisis for the 
Planet!" 
Barret: "The hell's that supposed to mean?" 
Cloud: "I'll tell you later! Just take my word for it! I'll go after 
I take care of him!" 
Barret: "Awright, Cloud!" 
(They all head back down to the 69th floor, but Cloud. Aerith pauses 
on the way out.) 
Aerith: "Cloud… I just thought of something." 
 
Tifa: "…I'll wait for Cloud! Everyone, get to the elevator!" 
 
Aerith: "Hmm, it's going to get pretty ugly from here on. We should 
check on our equipment." 
(Aerith, Barret, and Red XIII re-equip themselves and get on the elevator. 
As soon as they press the button to go down, they are attacked.) 
 




  
A Confrontation With The New President -
(Cloud stands on the balcony on the top floor with Rufus. They face each 
other. Cloud equips himself.) 
Rufus: "Why do you want to fight me?" 
Cloud: "You seek the Promised Land and Sephiroth." 
Rufus: "Hm, exactly." 
 
Rufus: "Mm? Did you know that Sephiroth is an Ancient?" 
Cloud: "…A lot has happened. Anyway, I can't let either you or 
Sephiroth have the Promised Land!" 
Rufus: "I see. I guess this means we won't become friends." 
 
Rufus: "Heh… That's all for today." 
(Rufus grabs the runner of the helicopter circling overhead and makes a 
spectacular getaway, as is typical of the villain. Cloud runs back down 
to the 69th floor, where he meets up with Tifa.) 
Tifa: "Where's Rufus?" 
Cloud: "I couldn't finish 'em. Looks like this's gonna get complicated." 




  
A Spectacular Escape Highway Battle -
(Aerith, Barret, and Red XIII arrive on the bottom floor. They go to the 
main exit.) 
Barret: "I'll go on ahead!" 
 
Barret: "*&^%(*… surrounded, huh?" "If I was alone this wouldn't be a thang but, I gotta reputation 
to protect." 
Aerith: "You all get out while you can." "It's not you they're after… it's me." 
Barret: "Yeah, well that ain't happenin'." "You got caught up in this over Marlene. Now, it's my turn to 
watch out for you!" 
 
Barret: "Ok, playtime's over for you jackasses…" 
 
Aerith: "…thank you, Mr. Barret!" 
 
Barret: "Who you callin' Mr. Barret? That don't sound right!" 
Red XIII: "Well then…" "If you are through talking, may I suggest that we think of a way 
to get out of here." 
Barret: "Huh? Oh, oh yeah… You a cold man. Just like somone else 'round 
here I know." 
Red XIII: "Did you say something?" 
Barret: "Notta thing. So what're we gonna do?" 
Tifa: "Barret!" 
 
Barret: "Tifa! Where's Cloud?" 
 
Tifa: "Everyone, over here!" 
Barret: "Huh? What's up? Where's Cloud?" 
Tifa: "I'll tell you later! Hurry, Hurry!!" 
(FMV sequence. The party follows Tifa to a safe distance. Cloud rides a 
motorcycle from the Shinra Showroom down the stairs. The party jumps into 
a pickup truck also from the showroom and follows Cloud; they drive up the 
stairs and crash through a window onto the freeway outside.)
[Here you play a minigame in which you must protect the truck from oncoming 
motorcycles. How well you perform determines how may HP you will have 
when you fight a boss at the end.] 
 




  
Ahead On Our Way -
(After the battle. The party stands on the freeway. They are at the edge, 
where it must have collapsed some time ago and never rebuilt, only added 
warning lights. The purple mountains of the eastern continent are visible 
in the distance.) 
Barret: "Well, what do we do now?" 
Cloud: "Sephiroth is alive. I… I have to settle the score." 
Barret: "And that'll save the Planet?" 
Cloud: "…Seems like it." 
Barret: "Awright, I'm going." 
Aerith: "I'll go too. …I have things that I want to find out." 
Cloud: "About the Ancients?" 
Aerith: "…….Many things." 
Tifa: "I guess this's good bye, Midgar." 
(They all climb down a rope hung from the edge of the highway, landing in 
the outskirts of Midgar.) 
Red XIII: "I'm going backto my hometown. I'll go with you as far as that." 
Tifa: "…I guess this is the start of our journey…" 
You hate traveling? It's dangerous. You sure you want to go? 
Cloud: You hate traveling? 
Tifa: "…I don't know. But, I don't have anywhere else to go. So I 
guess it doesn't really matter whether I like to travel or not." 
Cloud: It's dangerous. You sure you want to go? 
Tifa: "…..Mmm. but you know, it should be all right if you keep your 
promise." 

Aerith: "You know what? This is the first time I've ever left Midgar…" 
Really? …You worried? It's dangerous. You sure you want to go? 
Cloud: Really? …You worried? 
Aerith: "A little,… no, maybe a lot. But I have my bodyguard, right?" 
Cloud: It's dangerous. You sure you want to go? 
Aerith: "I thought you'd say that!" 

Barret: "We told Aerith's mom to go somewhere safe, so Marlene should be 
safe too." 
Yeah, she should be: Hmm, I don't know 
Cloud: Yeah, she should be 
Aerith: "She said she didn't want to stay in Midgar anymore. …Maybe 
it's for the best." 
Cloud: Hmm, I don't know 
Aerith: "Stop it, Cloud! I'm worried too." 

 
Cloud: "Then…" 
Let's stay here for a while: Let's go! 
Cloud: Let's stay here for a while 
Cloud: Let's go! 
 
Barret: "We need a group leader for our journey. 'Course only me could 
be the leader." 
Tifa: "You think so…?" 
 
Aerith: "It would have to be Cloud." 
 
Barret: "^#$^%……. awright. Go Northeast to a town called Kalm. If 
something happens, we'll meet up there." 
 
Barret: "'Sides, we can't have 5 people strolling down the fields. Split 
us into 2 parties…" 
 
Barret: "…Thought you'd do that." "'Later, at Kalm!" 

   
Cloud Begins His Story 
(They arrive at the city of Kalm. It is a charming, idyllic town with a 
Dutch appearance.) 
Tifa: "So this is Kalm?" 
Aerith: "I wonder if everyone's there already. Let's hurry over to the 
inn!" 
 
Tifa: "Let's go Cloud." 
 
Aerith: "Cloud, you're late!" 
Barret: "Yo man, you're late!" 
Cloud: "Sorry to keep you waiting." 
Aerith: "Guess everyone's here now." 
Barret: "So let's hear your story……" "You know, the one about Sephiroth and the crisis facing the 
planet." "Let's hear it all." 
 
Cloud: "……I used to want to be like Sephiroth, so I joined SOLDIER." "After working with Sephiroth on several missions, we became 
friends." 
Barret: "You call that a friend?" 
Cloud: "Yeah, well……." "He's older than me, and he hardly ever talked about himself." 
Tifa: "…………" 
Cloud: "So I guess you'd call him a war buddy….. We trusted each 
other. Until one day……" 
Aerith: "…one day?" 
 
Cloud: "After the war it was SOLDIER's duty to put down any resistance 
against the Shinra." "………..that was 5 years ago." "I was 16…….." 
   
Our Monster 
(The  changes. We are now in a military truck, on a bumpy ride along 
an old, almost-forgotten road. The windshield wipers do little to defend 
against the pounding rain. Boxes and crates are strewn about. Cloud stands 
near the back of the truck. Two Shinra soldiers sit on crates. Sephiroth
sits on another.) 
Cloud: "It sure is raining hard." 
 
Cloud: "Hey, how are you doing?" 
 
"I'm all right." 
Cloud: "I wouldn't know…" "I've never had motion sickness." 
 
Cloud: "Everything okay?" 
 
Sephiroth: "Hey." 
 
Sephiroth: "Settle down." 
 
Cloud: "They gave me new Materia." "I can't wait to use it." 
Sephiroth: "…just like a kid." 
 
Cloud: "You going to brief us about this mission?" 
Sephiroth: "…this isn't a typical mission." 
Cloud: "Good!" 
Sephiroth: "Why do you say that?" 
 
Cloud: "I joined SOLDIER so I could be like you." "But by the time I made First Class, the war was already over." "My big hopes of becoming a hero like you ended with the war." "That's why I always sign up whenever there's a big mission. Kind 
of a way to prove myself." 
 
Cloud: "Say, how do you feel, MISTER Sephiroth?" 
Sephiroth: "…I thought you wanted a briefing?" 
 
Sephiroth: "Our mission is to investigate an old Mako reactor." "There have been reports of it malfunctioning, and producing 
brutal creatures." "First, we will dispose of those creatures, Then, we'll locate 
the problem and neutralize it." 
 
Cloud: "Brutal creatures… Where?" 
Sephiroth: "The Mako Reactor at Nibelheim." 
Cloud: "Nibelheim…" "That's where I'm from." 
 
Sephiroth: "Hmm… hometown…" 
 
"Sir…s, something strange just crashed into our truck!" 
 
Sephiroth: "That would be our Monster…" 
(Battle sequence in which Sephiroth and Cloud fight a massive dragon. We 
see that Sephiroth has 30 times Cloud's HP, and can do about 300 times the
damage. Sephiroth never loses any HP to the dragon's attacks. The  
changes, back to the inn at Kalm.)  
Cloud: "Sephiroth's strength is unreal. He is far stronger in reality 
than any story you might have heard about him." 
Aerith: "So… Where do you come in?" 
Cloud: "Me? I was mesmerized by the way Sephiroth fought." 
Tifa: "………." 
Cloud: "……and then we reached Nibelheim." 
   
Nibelheim Homecoming 
(The  changes again. We are now at the front gate of Nibelheim, 
Cloud's hometown. Sephiroth approaches the gate, then stops and turns.) 
Sephiroth: "How does it feel?" 
 
Sephiroth: "It's your first time back to your hometown in a long time, 
right?" "So how does it feel?" "I wouldn't know because I don't have a hometown…" 
Cloud : "Umm…. how 'bout your parents?" 
Sephiroth: "My mother is Jenova. She died right after she gave birth to me. 
My father…" 
 
Sephiroth: "What does it matter…?" "All right, let's go." 
 
Guards: "Psst… (You keep wandering around here and you'll get into 
trouble.)" 
"It's so boring, being on watch." 
You want to do what we always do? Jut sit tight, it's your job, right? 
Cloud: You want to do what we always do? 
Cloud: "Shall we practice?" 
"Practice… oh, you mean practice my pose." "Does someone in SOLDIER always have to be careful about what 
other people think?" "…How did it go?" 
 
"Was it like this?" 
Cloud: "Good job!" 
 
"I really don't want to be in SOLDIER." 
Cloud: Just sit tight, it's your job, right?" 
Cloud: "I'll come and talk to you once in a while. Just stick with it." 

 
Sephiroth: "The Mako smell is pretty bad here." 
 
Barret: "Yo wait a minute!!" 
 
Barret: "Isn't that, um…?" "The name of Sephiroth's mother…" 
 
Barret: "I remember Jenova. That's that damn headless spook livin' in the 
Shinra building." 
Cloud: "That's right." 
Tifa: "Barret, would you please let us hear what Cloud has to say? You 
can ask questions later." 
Barret: "Tifa, I was only……" 
Tifa: "Okay Cloud, continue." 
Aerith: "It's a reunion of childhood pals!" 
Cloud: "……I was really surprised with Tifa." 
 
Cloud: "…The town was quiet." "Everyone must be staying in their houses, afraid to come out 
because of the monsters." "No, maybe they're afraid of us…" 
(The  returns to Nibelheim. We are at a courtyard, just inside the 
gate.) 
Sephiroth: "We leave for the reactor at dawn. Make sure you get to sleep 
early." 
 
Sephiroth: "All that we need is one lookout, so you others, get some rest." 
 
Sephiroth: "Oh, that's right…" "You may visit your family and friends." 
 
People in Nibelheim: "Man.. I'm so nervous." 
How come? I'm excited. 
Cloud: How come? 
"Look, you never know when a monster's gonna show up, right?" 
Cloud: I'm excited. 
"…That's right. Don't blow your chance to become a hero…" 

"I heard Sephiroth was coming and got my camera ready." "I want a shot of Sephiroth and a monster." 
Take my picture. Better get back in the house, it's dangerous. 
Cloud: Take my picture. 
"I don't take pictures with nobodys." 
Cloud: Better get back in the house, it's dangerous. 
"All right… so big-headed……." "Hey? This guy's a real…" "You…. Are you Cloud?" "Really? So that's how it is, huh?" "Gosh, Cloud, you've grown up to be a nice-looking kid." 
Then take my picture: It's dangerous, get back in your house 
Cloud: Then take my picture 
"Let's do this, Cloud. Let me take a picture of you with 
Sephiroth." 
Cloud: It's dangerous, get back in your house 
"OK, OK,…… So big-headed… You're just his assistant" 

"Welcome." "Hey? Aren't you…" 
 
Cloud: "…Have I come here before? …I don't remember." 
Barret: "Now you're pissin' me off! This don't matter, so get on with it!" 
 
Cloud: "This is… my house. It has nothing to do with that incident 
five years ago." 
 
Barret: "Yo wait, I wanna hear." 
Aerith: "Me too! It's been a long time, right?" 
Barret: "Tell us more!" "You saw your family, right?" 
Don't want to talk about it: All right…… 
Cloud: Don't want to talk about it 
Barret: "Well I ain't gonna force ya….." 
Cloud: All right…… 
Cloud: "I don't know if you could call it a 'family'…….." "My father… died when I was still very young." "That's why my mom…… was living alone in this house." "Yeah, I saw my mom." "My mom… she was a vibrant woman. Hadn't changed at all." "But a few days later, she died…." "But when I saw her, she looked fine." 
(The  returns to Cloud's house. Cloud takes a few more steps inside. 
We see his mother, working in the kitchen. She turns.) 
Cloud: "Uh…?" 
 
"Ye---s?" 
 
"Cloud!?" 
 
"Welcome home, Cloud!" 
Cloud: "Hi, mom." 
(The screen goes white…. Cloud is standing on the few steps leading up 
to a small sitting-area. His mother is by him.) 
"Come, come… Let me take a look at you!"
 
"Hmmm……." 
 
"You look so handsome." 
 
"So is this a SOLDIER uniform?" 
Cloud: "……Mom, I…." 
(The screen goes white again… Cloud is lying on the bed by the kitchen 
[it's a one-room house].) 
"My, how you've grown." "I bet the girls never leave you alone." 
Cloud: "…Not really." 
"…I'm worried about you." 
 
"There are a lot of temptations in the city…" "I'd feel a lot better if you just settled down and had a nice 
girlfriend." 
Cloud: "…I'm all right." 
"You should have…" "an older girlfriend, one that'll take care of you." "I think that would be the perfect type for you." 
Cloud: "……I'm not interested." 
(The screen flashes white again. Cloud and his mother are standing in the 
kitchen.) 
"Are you eating right?" 
 
Cloud: "I'm all right. The Company takes care of me." 
"Is that so?" "You can't cook, right?" "I was worried sick about how you were doing…" 
(The screen flashes white again. Cloud's mother turns to face him from 
the stove.) 
"Cloud…?" 
 
"You know, Cloud……" 
 
"…….isn't that right, Cloud?" 
 
"I will always be your mother…" 
 
Cloud: "………Let's stop this……" 
 

(Cloud enters Tifa's house. He takes a few steps in, then the screen fades 
to black.) 
Tifa: "Cloud…?" "Did you go into my house?" 
Yeah… No… 
Cloud: Yeah… 
Cloud: "I thought you might be home." 
Cloud: No… 
Cloud: "I remember you weren't there." 

 
Tifa: "Cloud…?" "Did you go into my room?" 
Yeah……. No…. 
Cloud: Yeah……. 
 
Cloud: No… 
 

 
Tifa: "Cloud!!!" 
It's true: Just kidding. Don't get mad… 
Cloud: It's true 
Tifa: "…Cloud" "We're talking about something really important here." 
Cloud: Just kidding. Don't get mad… 
Tifa: "…Cloud" "We're talking about something really important here." 

 
Tifa: "Did you play my piano?" 
No, I didn't: Yeah, I jammed on it: Just a little 
Cloud: No, I didn't 
 
Cloud: Yeah, I jammed on it 
"Now, how did this go?" 
I forgot: I remember 
Cloud: I forgot 
 
Cloud: I remember 
 

Cloud: Just a little 
Cloud: "I can read sheet music, too, you know….. Ummmm, let's 
see……" "Do… Re…. Mi… Ti… La… Do… Re… Mi… Ti… La….
Do… Re…. Do…. forget…" 

 
Cloud: "The letter…" 
Tifa: "Did you read it? My letter?" 
I'd never do that! Yeah… 
Cloud: I'd never do that! 
Tifa: "Of course!" 
Cloud: Yeah… 
Tifa: "You remember what it said? 
I don't remember… I remember clearly 
Cloud: I don't remember… 
Tifa: "Then. let's go on with the story about Sephiroth." 
Cloud: I remember clearly 
Cloud: "I read it…" "It was a letter addressed to Tifa from the son of the guy that 
runs the General Store…" 
"Tifa, how are you? I just arrived in Midgar eight days ago." "Yesterday, all of Nibelheim got together to welcome me. The only 
person that we couldn't get a hold of was Cloud." "But everyone said he wasn't really that close to us. So even if 
we asked, he probably wouldn't have come anyway." "Well, enough about him." "Midgar is really something. But to tell the truth, I feel so 
behind on everything… so out of it." "Even the rooms of people in the slums are clean." "Right now I'm living in the slums, but I plan to move to a 
really nice room, like the ones I've seen in magazines, once I make some 
money." "…but, to do that, I guess I have to find a job fast. That's 
right. I still haven't found a job yet." "I lied to my parents and told them I found a great job with 
Shinra, Inc." "I wonder if it's too late to back. Sometimes I think I should've 
taken over my parents' store." 
Tifa: "Cloud, do you remember all of it?" 
No, that's it: Yeah, I remember it all 
Cloud: No, that's it 
Tifa: "Then. let's go on with the story about Sephiroth." 
Cloud: Yeah, I remember it all 
Cloud: "Because there was some stuff about me…" 
"I just made it here to Midgar but all I think about is 
Nibelheim." "Hey, Tifa… Is that stupid old water tower still working?" "Is the old man at the Inn doing well? Are my parents still at 
the shop everyday? Have any monsters attacked?" "And most of all, how are you, Tifa? It feels like I haven't seen 
you for years." "We were all talking about you last night." "Everyone likes you. But because everyone idolizes you, I 
couldn't very well stab them in the back." "I always acted cool, but actually, I was just afraid of being 
jilted." "Wow, if I keep writing like this, this'll become a love letter!" "So, I think I'll stop here. Take care. I'll write again." "P.S. Write me back, okay?" 


"…Oh, you're with the Shinra? Welcome." "Oh, I'm sorry! It's you, Cloud! I didn't recognize you." 
 
"Shinra----?" 
"Chinra---?" 
"SOLDIER?" 
"Saltza?" 
"Are you going to kill the monsters?" 
"…..are you going to?" 
"Cloud, you've grown to be a strong man." 
"Do your best." 
"Do your best." 
"…..Hmmmm" "Is Shinra here to get rid of the monsters?" 
Cloud: "And who are you?" 
"I'm Zangan. I travel around the world teaching children martial 
arts." 
 
Zangan: "I have 128 students all over the world!" "In this town, a girl named Tifa is my student." 
Cloud: "Did you say Tifa?" 
Zangan: "Tifa has good sense. She'll be a powerful fighter." 
"The, uh…. The whole Inn's booked up by Shinra for the night." "…?" "Cloud…?" "Is it you, Cloud?" "It must've been two years." "Say, you've really moved up in the world, being under Sephiroth's 
command." 
(Cloud goes to the second floor of the inn. Sephiroth stands on the 
landing, looking out the window.)
Cloud: "What are you looking at?" 
 
Sephiroth: "…This scenery…….I feel like I know this place." "……….." "We have an early start tomorrow. You should get some sleep soon." 
It's still early. Yeah, let's get some sleep. 
Cloud: It's still early. 
Sephiroth: "…I'm not going to wake you up tomorrow." 
Cloud: Yeah, let's get some sleep 
Sephiroth: "I've hired a guide to the Mako reactor." "I've heard she's young. I hope we can rely on her…" 
 




   
The Mountains Of Nibel 
(The next morning. The group is outside, near the Shinra Mansion. Cloud 
speaks to Sephiroth.) 
Sephiroth: "Once the guide gets here, we're heading out." 
 
Tifa's father: "Listen to me, Sephiroth. In case something happens…" 
Sephiroth: "…Trust me." 
Tifa: "I'll be all right, Dad!" "I have two men from SOLDIER with me." 
 
Tifa: "I'm Tifa. Nice to meet you!" 
Cloud: "Tifa! You're the guide?" 
 
Tifa: "That's right." "I just happen to be the number one guide in this town."
Cloud: "It's too dangerous! I can't involve you in something like this!" 
 
Sephiroth: "Then there's no problem if you respect her." "….Let's go." 
 
"Ummm….." 
 
"Mr. Sephiroth! Please let me take one picture for a memento!" "Tifa, can you ask him for me too……?" 
(Cloud stands by the wall of the Shinra Mansion. Tifa stands next to him. 
Sephiroth, slowly, comes over and stands by Tifa.) 
"Cheeeeese!" 
(The photographer takes the picture. Sephiroth immediately walks toward 
the exit again.) 
"Great, thank you!" "I'll give each of you a copy once I get it developed!"  
 
There was a Mako Reactor built in Mt. Nibel. The cold air of the mountains of Nibel. It was no different… 
(We see the party walking along a mountain path, then Cloud at a rickety
rope bridge. He begins walking across and meets Tifa standing in the 
middle. She continues a bit. The two guards catch up.) 
Tifa: "It gets harder from here! Follow
me!" 
(She runs the rest of the way across. Cloud follows. He meets Tifa and 
Sephiroth near the opposite side, when the screen starts to shake…) 
Tifa: "Uh… the bridge!!"
(The bridge breaks in the middle. FMV sequence of the collapsing bridge. 
Cloud grabs Tifa's hand, holding her up, then Cloud falls, then everyone. 
The camera follows the broken, empty bridge as it swings, colliding with 
the side of the canyon. The  changes again. We see the party, sans 
one guard, land at the foot of the canyon…) 
Sephiroth: "Everyone seems to be all right. Can we get back to where we were?" 
Tifa: "These caves are intertwined, just like an ant farm…" "Oh, and Sephiroth…. There seems to be one person missing…"
Sephiroth: "It may sound cold, but we've got no time to search for him. We 
can't go back now, so we must go on. We'll travel together from here." 
(Cloud, Tifa, Sephiroth, and the one remaining guard travel along the path,
reaching a cave, dimly lit but with brightly colored, sparkling walls.) 
Cloud: "What's this?" 
Tifa: "A mysteriously colored cave…"
Sephiroth: "It must be the Mako energy. This mountain is especially abundant 
in it. That's why the Mako Reactor was built here." 
 
Cloud: "…And what's this?" 
Sephiroth: "A Mako fountain. It's a miracle of nature." 
Tifa: "It's so beautiful…" 
 
Tifa: "If the Mako Reactor countinues to suck up the energy, this 
fountain will dry up too…"
 
Sephiroth: "Materia. When you condense Mako energy, materia is produced." "It's very rare to be able to see materia in its natural state." 
 
Cloud: "By the way… Why is it that when you use materia you can also 
use magic too?" 
Sephiroth: "You were in SOLDIER and didn't even know that?" "…the knowledge and wisdom of the Ancients is held in the 
materia." "Anyone with this knowledge can freely use the powers of the Land 
and the Planet. That knowledge interacts between ourselves and the planet 
calling up magic….. or so they say." 
Cloud: "Magic…… a mysterious power." 
 
Sephiroth: "Ha, ha, ha!" 
Cloud: "Did I say somethin' funny?" 
Sephiroth: "A man once told me never to use an unscientific term such as 
mysterious power! It shouldn't even be called magic!" "I still remember how angry he was." 
Cloud: "Who was that?" 
Sephiroth: "Hojo of Shinra, Inc. … An inexperienced man assigned to take 
over the work of a great scientist." "He was a walking mass of complexes." 
 
Tifa: "A Mako fountain… So this is where the knowledge of the A
ncients is."  
   
Monsters Of The Nibel Reactor 
(We are at the Mako Reactor in Mt. Nibel. The group approaches the stairs 
up to the entrance.)
Tifa: "We finally made it. We sure took the long way though." 
Cloud: "Tifa, you wait here." 
Tifa: "I'm going inside too! I wanna see!" 
(Sephiroth climbs halfway up the stairs, then looks over his shoulder at 
Tifa.) 
Sephiroth: "Only authorized people are allowed in. This place is full of 
Shinra's industrial secrets." 
Tifa: "But!" 
 
Sephiroth: "Take care of the lady." 
(Cloud and Sephiroth climb up the stairs and enter the reactor. The guard 
blocks Tifa's path in.) 
Tifa: "Mm, man!" 
 
Tifa: "Better take real good care of me then!"  
(We see Cloud following Sephiroth into the Mako reactor. Look at the 
picture… look familiar? Cloud follows him through a door. The next room 
is bathed in red light. There are many metal pods in rows, each with a 
clear glass portal to look into. Sephiroth is standing at the top of the 
stairs leading though the middle of the rows. There is a door by him. 
Above the door is a plate with one word engraved on it Jenova….) 
Cloud 
"This is…… Jenova, right? The lock won't open…" 
(Cloud follows him partway back down the stairs, then stops. Sephiroth 
examines one of the pods.)

Sephiroth: "This is the reason for the malfunction. This part is broken." "Cloud, close the valve." 
(He walks to another pod. Cloud closes the valve on the first pod, then 
walks to Sephiroth.) 
Sephiroth: "Why did it break…?" 
 
Sephiroth: "…now I see, Hojo." "But, even doing this, will never put you on the same level as 
Professor Gast." 
 
Sephiroth: "This is a system that condenses and freezes the Mako energy… 
that is, when it's working correctly." "Now, what does Mako energy become when it's further condensed?" 
Cloud: "Uh, umm…… Oh yeah! It becomes a Materia." 
Sephiroth: "Right, normally. But Hojo put something else in there. …Take 
a look." "Look through the window." 
(Cloud hops up, peers into the pod and sees… a hideous, unnatural 
monster. He lets go of his handhold below the portal and lands sitting on 
the floor.)
Cloud: "Wh… what is this!?" 
Sephiroth: "Normal members of SOLDIER are humans that have been showered 
with Mako." "You're different from the others, but still human." "But what are they? They've been exposed to a high degree of 
Mako, far more than you." 
 
Cloud: "…Is this some kind of monster?" 
Sephiroth: "Exactly. And it's Hojo if Shinra that produced these monsters." "Mutated living organisms produced by Mako energy. That's what 
these monsters really are." 
Cloud: "Normal members of SOLDIER? You mean you're different?" 
 
Cloud: "H… hey, Sephiroth!" 
 
Sephiroth: "N… no…." 
 
Sephiroth: "…Was I?" 
(He draws his sword and begins furiously attacking the pods. Cloud jumps 
away.) 
Sephiroth: "…Was I created this way too?" 
 
Sephiroth: "Am I the same as all these monsters….." 
 
Cloud: "…Sephiroth." 
(Sephiroth just continues attacking the pod with his sword… then after 
a long moment, he stops, his shoulders heaving.) 
Sephiroth: "You saw it! All of them…. were humans…." 
Cloud: "Human!? No way!" 
 
Sephiroth: "….I've always felt since I was small…" "That I was different from the others. Special, in some way." "But… not like this…." 
(He looks down, shaking his head. Suddenly, there is a loud noise and he 
jerks his head up. FMV sequence. One of the pods explodes with a hiss of 
steam. The front half falls foward, revealing another monster, like the 
one Cloud saw. It lies there on the overturned dome of metal, not 
fully formed, twitching….. repulsive. The screen fades to black.)
Am I… human? I didn't quite understand what Sephiroth was saying at that time. I was even more surprised by that fact that Shinra was producing
monsters.
 
Barret: "Damn, Shinra! the more I hear, the more I hate 'em!" 
Tifa: "……who would have ever thought the Mako Reactor held a secret 
like that." 
Red XIII: "That would seem to explain the increase in the number of 
monsters recently." "I think we should listen carefully to Cloud. Don't you think so 
Barret?" 
Barret: "" 
Save game and take a rest: Keep talking 
Cloud: Save game and take a rest 
Barret: "Yeah, mebbe so. Wanna take a breather here?" 
 
Cloud: Keep talking 

 
Aerith: "Tifa…. You were waiting outside then?" 
Tifa: "…..Yes." 
Cloud: "We returned to Nibelheim. Sephiroth confined himself at the inn. 
He didn't even try to talk to me." 
Tifa: "Then all of a sudden he just disappeared, right?" 
Cloud: "We found him inside the biggest building in Nibelheim." 
Tifa: "The villagers used to call it Shinra mansion." 
Cloud: "Long ago, people from Shinra used to live in that mansion…"
   
Sephiroth's Thirst For Knowledge 
(The  is now Nibelheim. Cloud runs out of the inn with a guard, 
then runs to Shinra mansion. He passes through a group of people milling 
outside the gate, then enters. He climbs to a bedroom on the top floor. A 
guard is waiting at the door.) 
"There's no sign of Sephiroth, but I know I saw him go into this 
room…" 
(Cloud enters the bedroom. He passes through a secret door in the 
fireplace, down a long spiral staircase, and through a dark cave. He 
reaches a secret library, where Sephiroth paces back and forth, absorbed
in a book.)
Sephiroth: "….an organism that was apparently dead, was found in a 2000 
year old geological stratum." "Professor Gast named that organism, Jenova…" 
 
Sephiroth: "X Year, X Month, X Day. Jenova confirmed to be an Ancient…" "X Year, X Month, X Day. Jenova Project approved. The use of Mako 
Reactor 1 approved for use…" 
(Sephiroth walks down a narrow hallway lined with books. He stops and 
looks upwards.) 
Sephiroth: "My mother's name is Jenova… Jenova Project… Is this just a 
coincedence?"
 
Sephiroth: "Professor Gast… Why didn't you tell me anything? …Why did 
you die?" 
(Cloud leaves. The camera returns to the book-lined hallway. As Cloud 
speaks, we see a series of images of Sephiroth, reading. With each 
successive image, the bookshelves become emptier, and the stacks of books 
on the floor grow higher.) 
Sephiroth didn't come out of the Shinra Mansion… He continued to read as if he were possessed by something, and 
not once, did the light in the basement go out… 




   
Realization 
(Cloud is lying on a bed on the first floor of the Shinra Mansion. He 
awakens, and goes down to the library, passing the guard in the bedroom.) 
"Sephiroth seems different." 
(He continues down the stairs to the library. When he arrives, Sephiroth 
laughs from offscreen.) 
Sephiroth: "Ha, ha, ha…" 

Sephiroth: "Who is it!?" 
(Sephiroth is seated at a large desk, surrounded by books. The shelves 
that line the walls are in several places bare of books, and a couple of 
the shelves have fallen down.) 
Sephiroth: "Hmph… traitor." 
Cloud: "Traitor?" 
Sephiroth: "You ignorant traitor. I'll tell you." 
 
Sephiroth: "This Planet originally belonged to the Cetra. Cetra was a 
itinerant race. They would migrate in, settle the Planet, then move on…" "At the end of their harsh, hard journey, they would find the 
Promised Land and supreme happiness." 
 
Sephiroth: "But, those that disliked the journey appeared. Those who stopped 
their migrations built shelters and elected to lead an easier life." "They took that which the Cetra and the planet had made without 
giving one whit in return!" 
 
Sephiroth: "Those are your ancestors." 
Cloud: "Sephiroth…" 
Sephiroth: "Long ago, disaster struck this planet." 
 
Sephiroth: "Your ancestors escaped… They survived because they hid." "The Planet was saved by sacrificing the Cetra. After that, your 
ancestors continued to increase." 
 
Sephiroth: "Now all that's left of the Cetra is in these reports." 
Cloud: "What does that have to do with you?" 
Sephiroth: "Don't you get it?" 
 
Sephiroth: "An Ancient named Jenova was found in the geological stratum of 
2000 years ago." "The Jenova Project." 
 
Sephiroth: "The Jenova Project wanted to produce people with the powers of 
the Ancients….. no, the Cetra." 
 
Sephiroth: "…I am the one that was produced." 
 
Cloud: "Pr… produced!?" 
(The camera is now looking at Cloud and Sephiroth from down the narrow 
hallway.) 
Sephiroth: "Yes." "Professor Gast, leader of the Jenova Project and genius 
scientist, produced me." 
(Sephiroth walks down the hallway, then stops and stands motionless at 
the end.) 
Cloud: "How… how did he…?"
He runs after Sephiroth, then stops.) 
Cloud: "Se… Sephiroth?" 
Sephiroth: "Out of my way. I'm going to see my mother." 
(He walks, determinedly, out of the library. Cloud follows, out of the 
mansion.) 

:  

   
Nibelheim Aflame Tifa's Revenge 
(Cloud exits the Shinra Mansion. The entire village is consumed in fire; 
flames and smoke reaching high into the sky. He runs to the courtyard. 
Zangan is tending to an injured person lying on the ground.) 
Zangan: "Hey it's you! You're still sane, right?" "Then come over here and help me!" 
 
Zangan: "I'll check this house. You check that one over there!" 
(He runs into the house next to the Inn. Cloud speaks to the person on the 
ground. It's the photographer from before.) 
"Hey, Ummm… Am I going to die?" 
 
"Sephi… roth" 
(Cloud runs into the house next to Tifa's, his mother's house, then runs 
out. He shakes his head sadly, then walks to the center of the courtyard. 
The screen fades to black.) 
Cloud: "Terrible…" "Sephiroth… This is too terrible…"
(The camera switches to an angle where we can see both the courtyard and 
the Shinra Mansion. Near the steps leading down to the courtyard stands 
Sephiroth. Two townspeople rush toward him in an attempt to subdue him. He 
cuts them down with his sword. FMV sequence. Sephiroth stands in the midst 
of the flames, an empty expression on his face, then walks away, through 
the fire, unharmed. A flyby of the Nibel Mountains, past the Mako Reactor. 
Cloud dashes into the reactor and climbs down to the entrance to the pod 
room. Tifa is kneeling in front of the door. A long, thin, sword is on the 
floor nearby. A man lies before her, dead.) 
Tifa: "Papa…" 
 
Tifa: "Sephiroth!?" 
 
Tifa: "Sephiroth did this to you, didn't he!?" 
 
Tifa: "Sephiroth… SOLDIER… Mako Reactors… Shinra… Everything!" 
 
Tifa: "I hate them all!" 
(She stands, picks up the sword, then runs into the pod room. Cloud 
follows.)  
(Sephiroth stands before the thick steel door at the top of the stairs in 
the pod room. He places his hands on the door.) 
Sephiroth: "Mother, I'm here to see you. Please, open this door." 
(The camera pans downward. We see Tifa, wielding Sephiroth's sword and 
assuming a fighting stance, at the bottom of the stairs.) 
Tifa: "How could you do that to papa and all the townspeople?"
(She runs up the stairs in a blind fury. She tries to attack Sephiroth, 
who wrestles the blade away from her with ease. He cuts Tifa down. The 
sound of his blade echoes as we see Tifa, in slow motion, fly backwards 
and land, crumpled, at the bottom of the stairs. Cloud runs into the room 
and stops, in shock. Sephiroth, carrying his sword, turns calmly and walks 
into Jenova's room. Cloud runs to Tifa and kneels by her.) 
Tifa: "…You promised… You promised that you'd come…. when I was 
in trouble…" 
(Cloud picks up her up, gently, then carefully, tenderly, leans her 
against one of the pods. He rushes up the stairs, after Sephiroth.) 




   
J-E-N-O-V-A 
(Jenova's room. We see Jenova, a bizarre female being hidden beneath oddly 
angelic armor, connected to a mass of machines and electrical equipment. 
The camera pans down to show Sephiroth, standing facing his mother with 
his arms raised.) 
Sephiroth: "Mother, let's take this planet back together." "I've thought of a great idea. Let's go to the Promised Land." 
 
Cloud: "Sephiroth…" "My family! My hometown! How could you do this to them!?"
(Sephiroth, slowly, looks down and lowers his arms. His shoulders start
bouncing.) 
Sephiroth: "Ha, ha, ha….. They've come again, mother." 
 
Sephiroth: "With her superior power, knowledge, and magic, Mother was 
destined to become the ruler of this Planet." 
(FMV sequence. Sephiroth speaks to Jenova, 
But they… Those worthless creatures: are stealing the planet from Mother: But now I'm here with you: so don't worry 
then tears the upper half of her armor off, snapping wires and intricate 
machinery. We see what was inside the armor. Jenova's true form. A fragile, 
alien woman, skin blue as if she was frozen for many years.) 
 
Cloud: "What about MY sadness!? My family… friends… The sadness of 
having my hometown taken away from me!?" "It's the same as your sadness!" 
 
Sephiroth: "Ha, ha, ha… my sadness? What do I have to be sad about?" "I am the chosen one. I have been chosen to be the leader of this 
Planet." "I have orders to take this planet back from you stupid people 
for the Cetra. What am I supposed to be sad about?" 
 
Cloud: "Sephiroth…. I trusted you…" 
 
Cloud: "No, you're not the Sephiroth I used to know!" 
(The camera cuts between Cloud and Sephiroth, slowly at first, then 
building speed, until the two of them seem to blur into each other, Cloud 
with his sword raised for battle, Sephiroth, chin on his chest, his 
sword-grip held close to his face… the screen goes white.)




   
What A Fascinating Story… 
 
Cloud: "….and that's the end of my story." 
Barret: "Wait a damn minute! Ain't there more?" 
Cloud: "….I don't remember." 
Aerith: "What happened to Sephiroth?" 
Cloud: "In terms of skill, I couldn't have killed him." 
Tifa: "Official records state Sephiroth is dead. I read it in the 
newspaper." 
Aerith: "Shinra, Inc. owns the newspaper, so you can't rely on that i
nformation." 
Cloud: "……I want to know the truth. I want to know what happened 
then." "I challenged Sephiroth amd lived. Why didn't he kill me?" 
Tifa: "…….I'm alive, too." 
Aerith: "Seems like a lot of this doesn't make sense. What about Jenova? 
It was in the Shinra building, right?" 
Cloud: "Shinra shipped it from Nibelheim to Midgar." 
Aerith: "Did someone else carry it out after that? It was missing from 
the Shinra building." 
Tifa: "Sephiroth…..?" 
 
Barret: "Damn! Don't none of this make sense!" "I'm going, going, going, gone!" "And I'm leavin' the thinkin' to you!" 
 
Barret: "Yo, Cloud! Let's get a move on!" 
Wait a sec: Right 
Cloud: Wait a sec 
Barret: "Cloud, what's wrong? You just gonna stand there while Sephiroth 
heads for the Promised Land?" "I ain't lettin' Sephiroth or Shinra get to no Promised Land. If 
they do, then we're all screwed." "Y'know what I'm sayin'!" 
Beautiful, just beauiful! Is that all? 
Cloud: Beautiful, just beautiful! 
Barret: "Y'all jes' leave it to me!" 
Cloud: Is that all? 
Cloud: "Oh brother…" 
Barret: "Fine! That's good enough." 

Cloud: Right 
Barret: "Yo, c'mon let's go!" 

 
Cloud: "Oh brother…" 
Tifa: "………." "Cloud…?" 
 
Tifa: "How bad was I when Sephiroth cut me?" 
Cloud: "I thought you were a goner. ……I was really sad." 
Tifa: "………." 
Aerith: "I…" "The Ancients….. Cetra…. Jenova…… Sephiroth and 
myself….." 
Tifa: "Let's go. Barret's waiting." 
(Everyone leaves except Red XIII, still seated by the window, tail 
twitching curiously.) 
Red XIII: "What a fascinating story….." 
   
The Village Of Kalm 
(Cloud comes downstairs into the lobby of the inn in Kalm. Barret and Red 
XIII are waiting.) 
Barret: "Yo, Cloud. Here." 
 
 Access the menu and select [PHS]. It can 
only be used on the World Map or at a Save Point. 
Red XIII: "[PHS], will put us in constant contact with each other." 
Barret: "Awright then, we're outta here..". 
People in Kalm 
"Listen to me! Just now, some guy in a black cloak goes walked east towards 
that grassy field." "And he's got this killer sword, and is looking REAL scary……." 
"Tourists, huh? There are some things you should know that'll 
come in handy when you travel around the world…….." "Want me to tell you what they are?" 
Tell me: I already know 
Cloud: Tell me 
"Then let me explain how to use the world map." "Well then, what do you want to know?" 
Changing the camera angle: Map indicators: Operating the buttons 
Cloud: Changing the camera angle 
"First of all, press the [L2 button] on the controller to change 
the camera angle." "There are 2 angles to choose from, select the one you like." "You can then rotate the angles either way by pressing the 
[L1 button] and [R1 button]." "Try different angles until you find the one you like best. It 
makes the journey a lot more fun!" 
Cloud: Map indicators 
"Press the [Start button] once to view the World Map." "There is a large and small map. Learn when to use which, and you 
won't get lost as much." "Push the [Start button] twice to change the size of the map, and 
once more to turn it off." "Pretty easy, huh?" 
Cloud: Operating the buttons 
"You can ride things by pressing the [SELECT button] and get off 
by pressing the [cancel button]. This isn't so hard, either!" "Oh, yes, yes. You can't dash with the World Map on, so make sure 
not to press the [cancel button] unless you get off." "Remember this because Chocobos will run away as soon as you get 
off them, so be careful." 

Cloud: I already know 
"Is that so? Well, have a nice trip." 

"Thanks to Shinra, Inc. developing Mako energy for us, 
everything's more convenient now." 
"The famous floating city, Midgar… Just once I'd love to see it 
in person." 
"I heard President Shinra was killed. And his son Rufus, the new 
president, was badly hurt." "Hey, I bet that's news to you?" 
Hey you're pretty clued!! Don't care… 
Cloud: Hey you're pretty clued!! 
"Heh, heh, heh…. This is just between us. I heard it was that 
there Ava-whaddya call-ums that attacked the President Shinra and his son." 
Cloud: Don't care 
"Don't care? If you're going to travel, you'd best keep an eye on 
what Shinra's doing." 
<//>: "Shinra is leading the world around by the nose, and you guys are 
just gonna sit back and take it?" 
"I hear that the natural resources near the reactors are being 
sucked dry." "We're better off with them bringing in the Mako energy." 
"My old man was a miner, but he couldn't go to work after 
monsters started appearing in the Mythril Mine." "Now all he does is sit around getting drunk in the bar…" 
"Is it true that Shinra made a Monster?" 
It's true: Just a rumor 
Cloud: It's true 
Cloud: Just a rumor 
<//>: "Yeah, well, either way, as long as we're using the reactor, we 
can't stand up to Shinra." 
"I got my health, and enough to eat… all's well." 
"Thanks to Mako energy, life's pretty darn convenient. Thanks to 
Shinra." "Don't you think?" 
Yeah, maybe: You're full of it 
Cloud: Yeah, maybe 
"See!? How would we get by without Mako energy?"  
Cloud: You're full of it 
"Hmmn. But I hate to think of what life'd be like without Mako 
energy." 

"Yeah, Mako energy's made our lives much easier. And it's all 
thanks to Shinra, Inc." 
"Mako energy's made things a lot more convenient….." "But seems like a lot of plants and animals have been 
disappearing at a rapid pace." "I think the old life was better." "Don't you think so?" 
Yeah, maybe: No way 
Cloud: Yeah, maybe 
"Yeah, sure I'm right! You think so, don't you?" 
Cloud: No way 
"That sounds just like what my mom says." 
<//>: "I thought things were better when I was able to play with 
animals…." 
"Did you say you came from
Midgar?" "I used to live there, too. But I hear they got lots of troubles 
lately." 
"There was a suspicious-looking man in a black cloak! He was 
carrying a wicked-looking sword." 
"My older brother is so stupid. He's so embarrassing I could 
just puke!" 
"When I grow up I'm gonna be in SOLDIER. That's why I'm training 
so hard now!!" 
"I heard terrorists bombed a Midgar reactor…." "There sure have been a lot of dangerous accidents lately. I hate 
it, just hate it." 
"Me? I used to work in a coal mine down south called Mythril 
Mine." "But, right around then, monsters started appearing." "After that, business went to pot and now I spend the days here 
drinking."
"It seems there was this group called AVALANCHE runnin' around,
but I guess they finally got wiped out by SOLDIER." 
"Stay out of the kitchen." 
"This is the Item Store." (sells
items) 
"This is the Materia store."  
"This is the Weapons store."  




   
Chocobo Chocobo 
(Cloud and the others head east, to the Chocobo Stable. In the front 
pasture, several chocobos graze. Cloud speaks with one. After a brief 
conversation of "wark wark"s, the chocobo's dance the Chocobo Waltz! 
Afterwards, Cloud receives the Choco/Mog Summon materia. They go inside 
and meet with Choco Bill.) 
Choco Bill: "Thinking of crossing the marshes?"
Yeah: Not interested 
Cloud: Yeah 
Choco Bill: "Hmm, then it'll probably be safer for you to get a Chocobo." "That way you can zip through the marshes with the Chocobo." "It's the only way to avoid being attacked by the Midgar Zolom." "Midgar Zolom…?" "It's a serpent-like creature over 30 feet tall!!" "It picks up on footsteps that enter the marshes…" "And then, BAM!! It attacks!!!" "To avoid that, buy a Chocobo at the Choco Bill and Choco Billy 
Chocobo Farm." "To purchase a Chocobo, please talk to my grandson. He's in the 
Chocobo stables at the far right end of the farm." 
Cloud: Not interested 
Choco Bill: "Hmm, then, I guess that's that." 

 
Choco Billy: "Do you want a Chocobo?" 
Cloud: "Mmm……" 
Give me one: Nope 
Cloud: Give me one 
Choco Billy: "You old folks are out of luck!" 
Cloud: "Old folks…?" 
Choco Billy: "We're all out of Chocobos. I'm taking care of those ones out 
there for someone else." "You know, if you really want a Chocobo, you should go out and 
catch one." "Want to know how to catch a Chocobo?" 
Where are they? How do I catch one? What else? Not interested 
Cloud: Where are they? 
Choco Billy: "You see those claw prints out there? Wild Chocobo's will appear 
in those areas." "But, if you don't have 'Chocobo Lure' they won't come out. 
They're very cautious animals by nature." 
Chocobo Lure? Go on 
Cloud: Chocobo Lure? 
Choco Billy: "'Chocobo Lure' is a type of materia which attracts Chocobos." "If you equip this, they'll come to you. But, without it, they 
won't appear." 
Cloud: Go on 
Choco Billy: "Want to know how to catch a Chocobo?" 

Cloud: How do I catch one? 
Choco Billy: "A wild Chocobo always appears with other monsters." "But, you won't be able to catch it because of the monsters." "That is why you must defeat the monsters first before you catch 
the Chocobo." 
And then? That's all you can talk about? 
Cloud: And then? 
Choco Billy: "Also, wild Chocobos are really cautious. They'll run away from 
the slightest things." "But, if you use 'Greens' they'll focus on that, and won't run 
away." 
Cloud: That's all you can talk about? 
Choco Billy: "Want to know how to catch a Chocobo?" 

Cloud: What else? 
Choco Billy: "Whatever you do, don't make Chocobos angry. They're usually calm, 
but if you get them angry, you'll get hurt." "Oh, and remember, once you get off a Chocobo, it'll escape." "Want to know how to catch a Chocobo?" 
Cloud: Not interested 

Cloud: Nope 
Choco Billy: "Oh, I'm so glad!" 

Choco Billy: "Well then, shall we get down to business?" "I'll sell you the 'Chocobo Lure' for 2000 gil, right now." "You want it?" 
Buy it: Don't buy it 
Cloud: Buy it 
Choco Billy: "Thanks!" "It wouldn't hurt to buy some 'Greens' either." "Oh, and how fast a Chocobo'll finish eating depends of what type 
of 'Greens you feed them."  
Cloud: Don't buy it 
Choco Billy: "Mmm, if you don't have it, you'll never catch one." 
<//>
Chole: "Wasn't it really expensive?" "But don't be mad at my brother or Grandpa." "Ever since dad and mom died, it's been like this…" 
 
Choco Bill: "By the way, there was another person heading towards the 
Marshes." "Without a Chocobo, the Midgar Zolom probably got him. It was a 
man in a Black Cape."

(They leave the farm, go out, and fight… and fight… until they catch a 
Chocobo. They cross the marshes to the Mythril Mine.) 




   
Zolom Impaled The Mithril Mine 
(Cloud and the others arrive at the Mythril Mine. In front of the mine, 
impaled on a stake, is a Midgar Zolom. They run forward.) 
Cloud: "Did Sephiroth… do this…?" 
Tifa: "Amazing…" 
Aerith: "Our enemy is someone that could
do this…?"
(They enter the Mythril Mine. Just inside, they meet up with Rude of the 
Turks. Elena stands on a stone outcropping high above.) 
Rude: "Just a second!" 
Tifa: "Who are you?" 
Rude: "Do you know who I am?" 
From the Turks, right? Not interested 
Cloud: From the Turks, right? 
Rude: "Well if you know, this won't take long." 

Rude: "It's difficult to explain what the Turks do…" 
Cloud: "Kidnapping, right?" 
Rude: "To put it negatively… you could say that." "…But, that's not all there is to it, anymore." "…………….." 
 
Rude: "………………." 
"Sir!" 
 
Elena: "It's all right, Rude! I know you don't like speeches, so don't 
force it!" 
Rude: "…Then Elena, explain." 
Elena: "I'm the newest member of the Turks, Elena. Thanks to what you 
did to Reno, we're short of people." "…Although, because of that, I got promoted to the Turks…." "In any case, our job is to find out where Sephiroth is headed." "And to try and stop you every step of the way." 
 
Elena: "Wait a minute, it's the other way around. You're the ones that 
are getting in our way." 
 
Tseng: "…Elena. You talk too much." 
Elena: "Mr. Tseng!?" 
Tseng: "No need to tell them about our orders." 
Elena: "Sorry… Tseng." 
Tseng: "I thought I gave you other orders." "Now go. Don't forget to file your report." 
Elena: "Oh! Right!" 
 
Elena: "Very well, Rude and I will go after Sephiroth, who's heading for 
Junon Harbor!" 
Tseng: "…Elena. You don't seem to understand." 
Elena: "Oh! I'm, I'm sorry…" 
Tseng: "…Go. Don't let Sephiroth get away." 
Rude & Elena: "Yes sir!" 
 
Rude: "…Reno said he wanted to see you after the injuries you gave 
him healed." "He wants to show his affection for you all… with a new 
weapon." 
 
Tseng: "Well, then…" 
 
Tseng: "Aerith. Long time no see." "Looks like you got away from Shinra for a while, now that 
Sephiroth reappeared." 
Aerith: "…so what are you saying? That I should be grateful to 
Sephiroth?" 
Tseng: "No…" "Well, I won't be seeing too much of you, so take care." 
Aerith: "…strange, hearing that from you." 
Tseng: "Well then, stay out of Shinra's way." 
 
[Note: Here, you have the option of playing the Condor Fort mini game for 
practice. I chose not to, since you'll have to do it sooner or later.] 




   
Junon Fortress Resuscitation 
 
Cloud: "What happened to this town? It's so run-down…" 
People in Junon 
"Wow, now this is rare. We almost never have anyone other than 
the Shinra people visit this town." 
"Ever since… Shinra built that city up above during the war, 
…ugh, ugh." "There's been no fish in the water! It got so polluted… phew…" 
Cloud: "What kinda place is this?" 
"Who are you people? Where did you come from?" 
Cloud: "Did you see a man with a black cape?" 
"Hmm… I've never seen that feller before." 
"HEY! This is Shinra, Inc.'s elevator. Don't be snooping around 
here!!" 
"If you see a weapon you want, you'd better buy it."   
(Cloud and the others go down to the beach. A little girl is standing 
by the water.) 
"He-y! Mr. Dolphin!" 
 
"My name is…… Pri-scil-la! Now you say it." 
 
Priscilla: "Who are you guys? Are you members of the Shinra, Inc.?" 
Aerith: "No you're wrong! We have nothing to do with the Shinra." 
Cloud: "…that's how it is." 
Priscilla: "I don't believe you! Get out of here!" 
Cloud: "Great…" 
 
Tifa: "Look at that!" 
(A huge sea creature comes onto the screen. Priscilla runs forward, 
swinging her fists.) 
"Be careful Mr. Dolphin!" 
 
Cloud: "Hey! Hold on, we're coming!" 

(Cloud and the others all stand around Priscilla's unconscious body on 
the beach.) 
Cloud: "This is bad… You don't think she's dead, do you?" 
 
"Priscilla!!" 
 
"Nope… she's not breathing…" "Hey, that's it!" 
 
"Young man, CPR, now!" 
Cloud: "Mouth to mouth!?" 
Aerith: "Cloud, hurry!" 
Cloud: "But,… she's just a girl….." 
Tifa: "Cloud, what are you going to do?" 
"What? You don't know how? Come over here, I'll show you." 
Cloud: "Guess I gotta do it…" 
"Just take a deep breath, hold it in. Then breathe into her." "Hurry up and do it!" 
 
Priscilla: "Uh… ugh…" 
 
"Hey hey! Priscilla, are you alright?" 
(The man picks Priscilla up and carries her off. Cloud goes to her house 
where he stands in front of the door.) 
"Sorry, Cloud. Priscilla needs to rest for a while." 
(Cloud goes to the house near the exit of the town. An old woman stands in 
the doorway.) 
"Hey, come in for a while." 
 
"I heard what happened. You've done so much for Priscilla." "You all must be tired. If you want some rest, stay here." 
 
"Make yourselves at home." 
 
Aerith: "Want to rest?" 
Cloud: "Yeah…" 
We'll try later: Let's rest 
Cloud: We'll try later 
Cloud: Let's rest 
 

 
"…That reminds me." 
"You again?" "…Who are you?" 
"…You'll find out soon. ……But more importantly, 
5 years ago…" 
"5 Years ago… Nibelheim?" 
"When you went to Mt. Nibel then, Tifa was your guide, right?" 
"Yeah…. I was surprised." 
"But where was Tifa other than that?" 
"…I dunno." 
"It was a great place for you two to see each other 
again." 
"…You're right." 
"Why couldn't you see each other alone?" 
"…I don't know. I can't remember clearly…" 
"Why don't you try asking Tifa?" 
"…Yeah." 
"Then, get up!" 
"Hey wake up. Wake up, Cloud!" 
(The screen fades in to show Tifa standing in the room. Cloud gets out of 
bed) 
Cloud: "Tifa…" "When Sephiroth and I went to Nibelheim, where were you?" 
Tifa: "…We saw each other, right?" 
Cloud: "The other time." 
 
Tifa: "No… it was 5 years ago. I don't remember." "But, something seems strange outside. Cloud, come quick." 
 
(Cloud arrives in the middle of Nibelheim. There are loud trumpet fanfares 
playing in the background. All the others are waiting.) 
Aerith: "I heard that girl regained consciousness." 
Tifa: "Doesn't it seem a little strange? Everything getting so noisy 
all of a sudden…?" 
Barret: "Seems like something's goin' on up there!" 
Red XIII: "Does this have something to do with the Shinra?" 
(Cloud goes partway up the stairs to Priscilla's house, when Priscilla 
comes out to the top of the stairs.) 
Cloud: "Are you all right now?" 
Priscilla: "Umm… thanks for helping…" 
 
Priscilla: "I'm sorry, I mistook you for one of those Shinra, Inc. …" 
Cloud: "That's all right." 
Priscilla: "I'll give you something SPECIAL!" "It's an amulet. Take good care of it, ok?" 
 
Barret: "What's that music? It sure sounds lively." 
Priscilla: "I heard they're rehearsing the reception for the new Shinra 
president." 
Barret: "Rufus!? I gotta pay my respects." 
Priscilla: "Grandpa and grandma told me this beach was beautiful when they 
were small." "But after the Shinra built that city above, the sun stopped 
shining here, and the water got polluted…" "I was raised on that story amd hate Shinra so much, I could die!" 
Aerith: "You think Rufus is thinking about crossing the ocean from here, 
too?" 
"What? Does that mean Sephiroth already crossed the ocean?" 
Red XIII: "Cloud, didn't you finish Rufus off?" 
Barret: "We gotta get to the town up there… Mebbe we could climb the 
tower?" 
Priscilla: "No! No! There's a high voltage current running underneath the 
tower. Don't wander near it, it's dangerous!" "But… you might be able to if Mr. Dolphin helps you. Follow me!" 
 
Tifa: "High voltage tower……." "I guess this means Cloud'll be allright." 
Aerith: "Yeah, better leave it to Cloud!" 
Red XIII: "We're counting on you, Cloud" 
 
Cloud: "Hey!!" 
 
Cloud: "Wait a second!" 
 
Red XIII: "That looks like a Shinra soldier." 
Barret: "Yeah, I'd like to take a good look at the new President of 
Shinra, Inc.!" 
Tifa: "Don't you just hate this?" 
Aerith: "You're probably right." 
 
Priscilla: "Wait a minute." 
(Barret arrives in time to see the dolphin make a flying leap over a 
girder attached to the electric tower.) 
Barret: "Now ain't that something! I ain't never seen no Dolphin jump 
like that!" 
Priscilla: "Pretty cool, huh? When I blow this whistle, Mr. Dolphin jumps 
for me." "Here!! This is for you, Cloud!" 
 
Cloud: "A gift? What am I supposed to do with it!?" 
Priscilla: "Just go into the water, blow this whistle, and Mr. Dolphin'll 
jump you to the top of the pole!" 
Cloud: "Jump to the top of the pole?" 
"See that rod sticking out at the top? If you jump just right, 
you can climb to the top of the town." 
Barret: "Good luck Cloud! If you make it, we'll follow you." "Whoa, I'll hold the PHS for you. It'll break if it gets wet." 
"You wanna jump with Mr. Dolphin?" 
Cloud: Sure 

(Cloud swims to the base of the tower and blows the whistle. The dolphin 
jumps, bringing him with it, depositing him on the pole. He leaps over to 
a ladder and climbs to the top of the town.) 




   
Rufus' Homecoming -
(FMV sequence as Cloud climbs over the ladder onto a large deck. A huge 
airship, the Highwind, floats majestically above. Cloud travels to the 
interior of the base. Once inside, three soliders march by, followed by the 
captain. He catches Cloud.) 
"Hey! You still dressed like that!? Come 'ere!" "Here!! Get in the room!" 
 
"Today's the big day when we welcome President Rufus! Hurry up 
and change!" 
Cloud: "It's the Shinra uniform." 
Don't change: Change 
Cloud: Don't change 
Cloud: "There's Shinra soldiers all around. Better not try anything 
dumb…" 
"Quit yappin'! Hurry up!" 
Cloud: Change 
Cloud: "Brings back memories…" 
"Quit yappin'! Hurry up!" 
Cloud: "A Shinra uniform…" "I was so proud when I first put it on." 
 
Cloud: "I wonder when it was…" "…I couldn't stand wearing this thing anymore." 
 
"Wow! You look good in it!" "You remember the Greeting procedure, right!?" 
 
"…the look on your face says you forgot. All right, I'll show 
you again!" "Do just like we do." 
 
"Commander! We'll help too!" "This is how to do it." "We'll sing too!" 
"All right! Show 'em!" "Now, march! This's the Welcoming March!" 
"Then! I'll sing along with you!" 
"Quietly--!!" "Aaah!" "Aaah!" "Hey, come on now." "Now!" 
(The soldiers start singing the praises of Rufus, Shinra, etc. The captain 
instructs you.) 
"Keep in step with the soldier next to you and march smoothly!" "Once you're all in step, shoulder your gun!" "Got it?" 
Not yet: All clear! 
Cloud: Not yet 
 
Cloud: All clear! 

"Good! Make sure you do well at the real parade!" 
 
"Rufus has arrived! Preparation completed!" 
 
"All right, show time! Don't disgrace yourselves!" 
  
(We are at a long street in the middle of Junon. A helicopter hovers 
overhead. The captain is instructing the soldiers. Another soldier arrives.) 
"Begin the Welcome Parade!" 
(They move out. A flyby of scores of soldiers marching in formation. 
Rufus drives by in the back seat of a convertible, waving in true 
ticker-tape parade style. Back in the base, Cloud follows the soldiers 
out. FMV sequence: a flyby of the Junon cannon. Back at the long street, 
the soldiers arrive.) 
"Oh no! No one's here!" "Late---!?" 
 
"Hey! Rookie! It's because you're running around like that!!" 
"Captain! We'll take a short cut!" 
"Right!" "Good idea." "Get over here!" 
 
"All right! You first!"
(You end up at the end of the alley. The soldiers are marching in formation 
down the street. The captain gives you instructions to sneak into the 
line, and Cloud does so, controlled by the PLAYER.) 
TV Producer: "What the hell was that soldier doing?" 
AD: "I don't know." 
"Are the points up?" 
AD: "Well, it's so-so." 
"Hmm…" "Better send that soldier something." 
(You get an item. This whole  can be different depending on your 
parade performance.) 
(Cloud arrives at the top of Junon, on a paved platform beneath a huge 
tram that leads higher up into the base. He gets in formation with several 
other soldiers. Rufus and Heidegger stand nearby.)
"Good! We made it." 
"Oh! President Rufus!" 
"Hey! Line up and shut up." 
"Don't make a move!" 
 
Rufus: "How's the job?" 
 
Rufus: "What happened to the Airship?" 
 
Heidegger: "The long range airship is still being prepared." "It should be ready in about three more days. Gya haa haa!" 
Rufus: "Even the Air Force's Gelnika?" 
Heidegger: "…..Gya haa haa!" 
 
Rufus: "Stop that stupid horse laugh." "Things are different than when father was in charge." 
 
Heidegger: "Gya…" 
Rufus: "Is the ship ready?" 
Heidegger: "Yes Sir, we'll get it ready quickly." 
(Rufus enters the tram. Heidegger stands there laughing. The soldiers 
disperse as Heidegger runs forward right into Cloud. He smacks him around 
a bit before he follows Rufus into the tram.) 
"What a disaster." 
"Heidegger was really irritated…" 
"The man in the Black Cape's been roaming the city, but we can't 
find him." 
Cloud: "Man in the Black Cape?" 
"He showed up two or three days ago, and killed a few of our 
soldiers." 
"He disappeared right after that. There's a rumor going around 
that it was Sephiroth." 
"Attention! Dismissed!" 
 
"Hey! Hey you! You messing with the army?" 
Who cares? What if I am? 
Cloud: Who cares? 
Cloud: What if I am? 

"You're too lazy!! No break for you!!" "Get over here!" 
 
"This is the military, soldier! You orders for today are to send 
off President Rufus at the dock!"
"I'll keep drilling you until it's time!" 
 
"I'll help, sir!" 
"Me too, sir!" 
"All right!! Line up in order and show me your final pose!" "Today's command is Formation!" "Remember it!" "Ready!?" "Junon Military Send Off, BEGIN!" 
(The captain drills the soldiers on the send off just a game of Simon 
Says. He shouts a button, the PLAYER pushes it. Simple.) 
"All right! Now you try it!" 
 
"So you got it?" 
Not yet: I've got it 
Cloud: Not yet 
 
Cloud: I've got it! 

"All right! Don't mess up during the real thing!" 
"Commander! What's today's special pose?" 
"Huh? …I haven't decided yet." "All right, rookie! I'll let you decide!" "Show me your best move!" 
Cloud: "Let's see… My best move is…" 
 
"Woo-----ow!" 
"That's awesome!" 
"All right! We'll go with that as today's special!" "Practice it!" 
"Yes sir!!" 
"Yes sir!!" 
"Well then! Meet at the dock! Don't be late!!" "Attention! Dismissed!!"
(Cloud follows them to the dock. On the way, we see Rude on the long 
street. Cloud arrives and gets in formation.) 
"All right, it's time!" 
"President Rufus… has now arrived!" "Ten… HUT!" 
 
"This is it!! Junon Military Reception--!" "Do it right-- Do it with enthusiasm…! Ready…!" 
 
Rufus: "Well done." "Keep up the good work for Shinra, Inc." 
Heidegger: "Gya haa ha…!! Here's a special bonus for you!!" "A token of the President's kindness! Don't forget it!" 
 
Rufus: "Once the word gets out that Sephiroth's here, Cloud and his 
friends will show up, too." 
Heidegger: "We'll crush them as soon as we find them!" 
 
Rufus: "We can't have them get in our way." 
Heidegger: "Leave it up to me, sir! Gya haa ha!" 
Rufus: "I thought I told you to stop that stupid laugh…" 
 
Heidegger: "Gya……" 
 
"All right! Dismissed!" 
 
"That was close." 
"Heidegger's been really edgy lately." 
"Because Hojo disappeared, leaving a letter of resignation." 
"Heidegger's been forced to take care of that investigation, too." 
 
"Hey--! I thought you were dismissed!" 
 
"We've got some cleaning to do! Hurry up!" 
 
Cloud: "We'll cross the ocean, to the new continent." "…even if we are wearing Shinra's uniforms…" 
 




   
The Boat Ride Jenova BIRTH -

People on the ship 
"I'm workin' hard already, and you still want me to do more?" "The new President's probably the same." "He's just gonna order us around anyway." 
A soldier: "Umm…. It's me, Aerith." 
Aerith: "Hey, Cloud. Did you see the Airship at Junon?" 
Cloud: "…I heard it was big, but I didn't expect it to be THAT big." 
Aerith: "That was REALLY something." "Hey, do you think I could get on it?" 
I'll take you someday: I dunno… 
Cloud: I'll take you someday 
Cloud: "…keep hoping." 
Aerith: "Wow! I'm really looking forward to it!" "Let's ride the Airship together, OK? Promise, promise me!" 
Cloud: I dunno… 
Cloud: "It's a Shinra weapon. We probably should've destroyed it." 
Aerith: "…Hmm. But just once, I'd like to ride it." "Just once, I'd like to ride that Airship." 

"It won't do any good trying to stop me!" "All right! I'm going to show the new President what I'm made of!" 
"Hey, get to work!" "Both the new President Rufus and Heidegger are aboard this ship!" "If we do good, we could get promoted!"
A soldier: "Yes sir! Everything quiet, sir!" 
Tifa: "…But, you know what? I really hate this uniform." "Uniforms, soldiers, war. I hate 'em all." "They take away the things and people you love…" "I wish they'd all disappear. Right, Cloud?" 
Yeah….. I don't know 
Cloud: Yeah……. 
Tifa: "You're right!" "Uh, yes sir, I'll continue my watch sir! Hee hee…." 
Cloud: I don't know 
Tifa: "…Cloud. Wearing those clothes seems to have changed you a 
little." "Does it remind you of being in SOLDIER? I hope not…" 

"Hey! What's wrong, kid? You got no pep!" "A seaman's gotta have umph!" 
I'm tired…. Something's missing: Leave me alone 
Cloud: I'm tired…. 
"I got just the perfect this! 'Invisible Alpha'- A super drink 
for seamen!" "Just one'll rejuvenate you! Only 250 gil!" 
I'll take it: No thanks 
Cloud: I'll take it 
"Thanks! This is a necessity for a sailor." "This is a must item for a sailor! Ha ha ha!" 
 
Cloud: No thanks 
"Hey! Seamen shouldn't be so stingy!" 

Cloud: Something's missing… 
"Ey ey! Whattaya mean, 'missin'!?"  
Cloud: Leave me alone 

"Oh man, we're almost to Costa del Sol." "When I get there, I'm going to take a long overdue vacation. 
Maybe I'll go down to the beach and get a tan…" 
A soldier: "……. …It's me. Red XIII." 
Red XIII: "I'm a little woozy, but I shouldn't get caught." "Humans only look at appearances anyway." "Anyway you look at it, I'd say I make a fine human being." "It's pretty hard standing on two feet…" 
 
Aerith: "Hey, Cloud, did you see Barret?" "I hope he's not doing anything stupid…"
(Cloud goes back up to the deck, where he finds Barret, dressed like 
Popeye, peering in a bay window at Rufus and Heidegger.) 
Barret: "Look, Cloud. It' Rufus and Heidegger." "They're this close but we can't do a thing to 'em…" "Ummmmmm….. Gmmmmmm….." "How can he…… Goin' off laughin' like that?" "Because of him, Biggs…… Wedge……. Jessie…..!" "Gggggggh…. Ggggh…..! Ggggggggghhh!!" 

Barret: "God!! I can't take it anymore!" "I'm gonna settle things here and now…." 
 
"Emergency alert! Reports of a suspicious character found! Those 
not on detail, search the ship. Report when found!" "I repeat. Suspicious character found on board! Those not on 
detail, search the ship. Report when found!" 
Barret: "Damn, did they find us?" "Hey, that don't seem like us. Do they mean…. Tifa and the 
others!?" 
 
Barret: "Get off your spikey butt and let's go, Cloud!" 
 
Tifa: "Everyone all right!?" 
Barret: "You all right!?" 
Aerith: "Huh?" 
Tifa: "Everyone's here… right?" 
Barret: "Hey, wait." "You don't think that suspicious character is…." 
"Sephiroth!?" 
Tifa: "Really!?" 
Barret: "How the hell am I supposed to know!?" 
Cloud: "….Let's find out." 
Red XIII: "It's the most logical thing to do. Then, who's going to go?" 
(The PLAYER chooses a party here once again, I took Aerith and Tifa. 
Everyone is now in their normal clothes.) 
Cloud: "…..Sephiroth……." "……..All right, let's go!" 
(They travel down to the engine room. Dead or dying people are strewn all 
over.) 
"….the Engine Room… a suspicious….. character…" "No… there's no way…. that…… not a human….. That 
thing's not human….." 

Cloud: "Is it…….. Sephiroth?" 
 
Cloud: "No… not Sephiroth!" 
"……..After a long sleep…" 
 
"…the time…" "…time has……. come….." 
Aerith: "Look, Cloud!!" 
 
Cloud: "Sephiroth! You're alive!" 
"……..Who are you?" 
Cloud: "You don't remember me!? I'm Cloud!" 
"Cloud…" 
Cloud: "Sephiroth! What are you thinking!? What are you doing!?" 
"…the time….. is now……" 
Cloud: "What are you saying!? Be more…"
(The figure of Sephiroth rises, then crashes into Cloud and the others, 
sending them to the floor. It soars skyward.) 
 
 
Tifa: "I've seen this somewhere… before." 
 
Cloud: "…Jenova. The arm of Jenova." 
Aerith: "Jenova… With this thing?" 
 
Cloud: "So it WAS Sephiroth." 
Tifa: "He said something about it being time for something." 
Cloud: "……Time…is now?" 
Aerith: "Hmmm… I don't get it." "Hey, Cloud. Can you explain it to us?" 
I'll try: Too much trouble 
Cloud: I'll try 
Cloud: "I'll try, but don't interrupt me while I'm explaining." 
 
Cloud: "Sephiroth went off searching for the Promised Land, so he could 
become the ruler of the planet… That was 5 years ago." "Then Sephiroth came back and killed President Shinra." 
 
Cloud: "And then just now all of us saw Sephiroth." 
 
Cloud: "He was carrying Jenova with him." "…This much I do know. He told me he wants to go to the 
Promised Land with his mother, Jenova." "….I guess that's about it." 

 
"Dock workers- We will be docking in Costa del Sol in 5 minutes. 
Prepare for docking." 
Aerith: "Maybe we shouldn't stay in here anymore…" 
 
Cloud: "Sephiroth….. is alive…" "The Promised Land…. Does it really exist…?" 
 




   
Landing At Costa Del Sol 
(On the world map, we see the Shinra ship dock at Costa Del Sol. Everyone 
leaves the ship.)
Barret: "Damn! Sure is hot here!" "But I sure feel better now that I can say good-bye to this 
sailor suit." "Yo listen up!! Y'all be sure to mingle like regular folks here!" 
Aerith: "Oh, too bad. I liked Barret's sailor
suit. He looked so cute." 
Barret: "…..What'ya mean " cute " ?"
Tifa: "Right… well, uh…" "Barret, why don't you use that sailor suit for pajamas?" "Right, Cloud?" 
I guess: Keep your mind on Sephiroth 
Cloud: I guess 
Cloud: "Ahhh…. You look like a bear wearing a marshmallow." 
Barret: "The hell's that supposed to mean!? This happens to be the most 
comfortable, so shu'up!" 
Cloud: Keep your mind on Sephiroth 
Cloud: "Remember, this isn't a vacation. We're here after Sephiroth." "I'm going on ahead." 
Barret: "Hmmmph, Cloud. You're the one, who's always hangin' around 
wastin' time." "I'm going to skip this resort!" 

Red XIII: "…puff…puff…" "Would you kindly hurry? The heat here is drying my nose." 
Cloud: "All right. We'll take a break here and then head off." "Don't wander too far off." 
Barret: "I'll wander wherever I damn well want! Who made him the leader?" 
Red XIII: "It looks like my mane got messed up." "I'm going to rest somewhere cool." 
  

(A helicopter hovers over the dock. It lands on an elevated pad near the 
water. Rufus and Heidegger get off the ship. Two sailors begin working on 
the helicopter.) 
"What a long boat ride that was!!" 
Rufus: "Hmmm…… Good work everyone….." 
Heidegger: "Gya, Heh, heh…, ha!! Hurry up with that!" 
"Yes, sir!!" 
 
Rufus: "I heard Sephiroth was on board." 
Heidegger: "…..Yes." 
 
Rufus: "And it seems Cloud and the
others were on board, too." 
Heidegger: "….Yes." 
 
Rufus: "They all slipped through…… You messed up big this time, 
Heidegger." 
Heidegger: "I'm ashamed of myself." 
Rufus: "Is that all you can do…?" "Give one word answers and apologize for everything?" 
 
"Ready for departure, sir!!" 
 
Rufus: "…..Do something. I'll be expecting results." 
(Rufus continues to the helicopter. As soon as he is out of sight, 
Heidegger begins beating up anyone in sight on the dock, throwing sailors 
into the ocean. The helicopter takes off.) 
   
Hojo On The Beach 
People in Costa Del Sol 
"Hey! Spread out, all of you, out!!" "Put any fingerprints, scratches, or dents in that plane and I'll 
put one in your head!" "Da plane, da plane!! That's something you'll never be able to do 
in your lifetime." "So you just watch from a distance… and wish." 
"He's quite handsome, isn't he?……" "Oh, don't worry, I'm not talking about you." "I'm talking about President Rufus. Charming, rich, blond… He 
even looks good in a double-breasted suit." 
"Rufus complimented me on my job!" "Wow!! I guess it pays to do good work." 
Shinra manager: "Oh, oh, oh!!! I'm gonna quit this company!!" "I mean it. I'm really gonna quit!!" 
 
Shinra manager: "Heidegger's such an idiot!!" "And Rufus, acting all big!!" "God, that sure felt good…." 
"Damn. I'm soaking wet down to my underwear." "Oops! You must be those AVALANCHE guys!" "Quick! Let's get outta here! Heidegger's in charge of the 
transport ship." "That's tough for both of us." 
"What a fluffy bed…… feels so great…." 
"…SNORE…SNORE…" "Geez my lower back's killing me!" "Y, yes…sir!!" "How do you do! I'm the Manager." "Nice to meet you." "Well, if you'll pardon me, I'll be leaving. Good-night." "Oh, those items are free, so please help yourself." 
"Say, aren't you bored?" 
Not that much: Yeah, we fight a lot 
Cloud: Not that much 
"Oh, really? I'm a little bored." "Come on, back to work now!" 
Cloud: Yeah, we fight a lot 
"Isn't that good? You're just expecting too much." 

"Here you are! The Costa del Sol tourist information guide." "What do you want to know?" 
Where's the inn? Where're the stores? Show me around town 
Cloud: Where's the inn? 
"Let's see. I recommend a resort located on the outskirts of the 
city." 
Cloud: Where're the stores? 
"If you're not looking for souvenirs, we recommend Butch's." 
Cloud: Show me around town 
"Wait a minute. I'm going to look for my guidebook." "It says, Costa del Sol is the gateway to the West. And has a 
prominent world renown resort, which has been around for ages." "Come on!! I don't care about that." "If you want a good time, come to the beach! There are lots of 
beautiful women." "You wouldn't happen to be… rich?" 
Oh yeah… Well, not so 
Cloud: Oh yeah… 
"You're kidding! You can't tell just by looking." "But I'll tell you just in case." "After relaxing in Costa del Sol, stop by the Gold Saucer. It's a 
rich and exciting place to play!" 
Cloud: Well, not so 
"I thought so." "Are you interested? This is the road to Gold Saucer." 
<//>: "Head south to the Gold Saucer, and you'll find casinos and an 
amusement park." "But if you're planning to walk, you'll have to cross mountains 
and valleys. I wouldn't recommend it." "But if you're on a vacation, you should go there at least once." 

"We're all headin' over to the Gold Saucer now." "We're gonna make a ton of money at the Chocobo races." "Then we're gonna take a trip to Icicle Inn and snowboard." 
"Yeah, snowboarding's what's happening this year." "I'm sick of surfing." 
"You want drink? Iz ok. You take time." 
"…huff…puff… I can't stand hot places…" 
"……HIC… Mm? Wanna order? We're outta that now." 
Mukki: "I really like this town." "You could walk around nearly naked, and no one'd look twice at 
you." 
"Hey! I thought you'd drop by." "( That's 1,2… 4 fishes all together… not bad." 
"Come on… please. If you don't buy from me… I can't make ends 
meet."  
"Shall we play our hand around here?" 
"Not yet. Remember, no compromises." 
"You're right. After all, this trip was expensive." 
"But only your average Joes are trying to pick us up." 
"Well, that's because we're just too beautiful and hard to 
approach." 
"I guess so. Well, I envy the plain Janes." 
"Why don't we compromise? We'll make do with what we have." 
"I heard. That big dog talks like a human." "That's cool… but it's weird." 
Red XIII: "Hm, that's interesting." "It's not as if I'm doing this because I want to." "You see, this tail of mine, moves quite independently of my 
will." 
"1, 2, 3, here we go!" 
Butch: "Yeah, I'd like to hire a gorgeous chick and have a great time." 
 
"How about a 'Soft' as a memento of this wonderful trip? Made 
especially in Costa del Sol!"  
Johnny: "What's with YOU!!" "Hey, is it…….. you?" "We were in SOLDIER, and childhood friends before that. You were 
such a playboy." "And a $#&^ murderer!!" "Why can't I remember your name?" 
Who are YOU? I'm Cloud, and don't forget it 
Cloud: Who are YOU? 
Johnny: "That's right. Long time no see. Do you remember me?" "That's okay. We'll just keep on like we don't know each other." "I'm starting a new life in this town." "A lot of things happened to us. Heh, I better stop my mumbling! I 
sure envy you all just living outside with the sky as your ceiling." 
Cloud: I'm Cloud, and don't forget it 
Johnny: "You think you're good enough to go around bragging about who you 
are?" "I don't wanna hear it! Heh, no more mumbling from me!" "From now on, I'm starting a new life!" 

"I'm sorry about that. He's had some big shocks lately and is 
pretty depressed." 
Johnny: "Hurry up and get out of here!" "I'm happy like this. So keep out of my life." 
 
Barret: "Uh uh!" "Hmmmm!?" "Marlene! You ok?….." "Dad'll wear this when I go to see you." 
(Barret is in the bathroom, wearing his sailor suit and posing in front of 
the mirror. Cloud bangs on the door) 
Barret: "Hey, yo!!! Someone's in here, awright?" 
"Uggh! I feel God awful! Oh!! You!" "Weren't you the one with that big sailor?" 
Dunno what you're talking about: Wasn't me 
Cloud: Dunno what you're talking about 
Cloud: "What's the matter?" 
"Listen to this…" "All of a sudden, this big sailor just busts in here, and takes 
over the restroom." "He's been in there moaning ever since." "I don't know what I'm gonna do.." 
Cloud: Wasn't me 
Cloud: "I don't know." 
"Wrong guy? It puts us in a bad situtation. That guy's taken over 
the john." "And he hasn't even paid his hotel bill yet." 
"Ah… if you're checking in, would you pay his bill, too?" 

 
Barret: "Yo, Cloud! Still too early, ain't it?" 
 
"What now? Call it a night?" "200 gil a night."   
 
Aerith: "Oh! Cloud!!" 
Tifa: "Look, look at that!" 
(The camera pans over to show Hojo reclining in a beach chair, surrounded 
by beautiful women.) 
Cloud: "Hm…?" 
Who, Hojo…? That girl in the bikini……? 
Cloud: Who, Hojo?  
Cloud: "Is that man over there, Hojo?" 
Tifa: "Go over and talk to him." 
Cloud: That girl in the bikini……? 
Cloud: "Not a bad view…." 
Tifa: "What're you looking at?" "That man over there. That's Hojo from Shinra. Get outta here. Go 
talk to him!" 

 
"God!! What do you want?" 
I want to talk with that man: Is that Hojo? 
Cloud: I want to talk with that man 
"" "Professor Hojo. That scary man says he wants to talk with you." 
Cloud: Is that Hojo? 
"" "Yes, that's right. It's the Professor!" "Professor… someone's here to see you, sir." 

Hojo: "I'm busy right now." 
"…..But. Too bad." 
Hojo: "Oh, I remember you all now." "Yes, yes. I remember now." 
 
Hojo: "It's been a long time, Cloud." 
Cloud: "Hojo….." 
Hojo: "Sometimes you just gotta do something like this." 
Cloud: "….What are you doing?" 
Hojo: "It should be obvious. I'm getting a tan." 
Cloud: "Answer me!" 
Hojo: "Hmm! I believe we're both after the same goal." 
Cloud: "You mean Sephiroth?" 
Hojo: "Did you see him?" "I see….. Ha! Ha!" 
 
Cloud: "What is it?" 
Hojo: "Nothing. I just remembered a certain hypothesis……." "Haven't you ever had the feeling something is calling you?" "Or that you had to visit some place?……" 
Cloud: "I'll go anywhere Sephiroth is at!" "To beat him and put an end to all this!" 
Hojo: "I see…… This could be interesting." "Were you in SOLDIER? ….Heh heh heh! Would you like to be my 
guinea pig?" 
 
Hojo: "Oh, now what? Are you going to draw your sword?" 
Tifa: "Stop, Cloud! I know how you feel, but you mustn't." 
 
Hojo: "Ha! Ha! Ha!…." 
 
Hojo: "Say, aren't you the 'Ancient?'" 
Aerith: "I'm Aerith. The least you can do is remember my name." "I want you to tell me something, Professor Hojo….." "I know I'm an Ancient. My mother told me." 
Hojo: "Your mother? Oh, you mean Ifalna. How is she?" 
Aerith: "You didn't know? She died." 
 
Hojo: "……I see." 
Aerith: "Professor Hojo…." "Is Jenova an Ancient? Is Sephiroth an Ancient? Do we all have 
the same blood?" 
Hojo: "……mumble….mumble….. head west…." 
Aerith: "He's mumbling slowly…. That must mean he's hiding something!" 
 
Hojo: "…………….." 
Tifa: "Hey! Answer us!!" 
 
Cloud: "…….It's no use. It's no go."  

"He never takes off his lab coat even in thie heat. I guess 
that's the mark of an intellectual." 
"I'd be happy to be a guinea pig, if it's for Professor Hojo!" 
"Yipes! Help!!" "….breath…. breath…! Kind of takes your breath away, don't 
it!?" 
"If you're headed for Mt. Corel, then you'd better buy some 
'Soft.'" "At least that's what they always say, don't they?" "Be prepared, and you'll never fear." "Hey, I'm no idiot. I NEVER count my chickens before they hatch! 
Pretty good, huh?"  




   
Mountain Pass Another Reactor 
(They leave Costa del Sol and head south, until they reach a mountain 
pass. A man is resting there) 
"Whew!" "Hey!" "You're actually talking to me."
Cloud: "What is it?" 
"I just passed a guy in a black cape back there." "I just tried to tell him that it's dangerous up ahead, and he 
ignored me!"
Cloud: "Sephiroth…." 
Aerith: "There was a black-cloaked guy here, too?" 
Tifa: "Let's hurry on."

(They continue on, past the mountain pass, passing a Mako reactor and 
crossing many mine-car tracks, until they reach a bridge. The other two 
are there.) 
Red XIII: "Wha? Oh, it's you." "There seems to be an instrument in that hut that manipulates 
this bridge." "Perhaps it's best if we rest a moment." 
 
"The shack is here!! ;" 
Cloud: "Ok, then…." 
PHS: Let's move on!
Cloud: PHS 
 
Cloud: Let's move on 
 


Cloud: "OW!! Sure is tight in here…" "Come on, Cloud, don't let it get to you. Let's see… this is 
it." "Maybe if I turn this…" "…something should happen." 
Do it: Leave it 
Cloud: Do it 
(Cloud turns the switch. The drawbridge lowers and the other party members 
run across.)  

Cloud: Leave it 
 

(Here you have the option of climbing the side of the mountain. At the 
top, you find two baby birds, nesting on top of a treasure.) 
Aerith: "How cute!!" 
Tifa: "Yes!! ….how cute." 
Cloud: "What should we do?" 
Take the damn treasure: Leave it where it is 
Cloud: Take the damn treasure 
Cloud: "Times are tough… I'm taking the
treasure." 
Tifa: "Oh! Cloud! Your hair looks like a
Chocobo!" 
Aerith: "Cloud……" 
(After a battle with a Cockatrice [ the mommy, we presume ], you receive 
10 Phoenix Downs.)
Cloud: Leave it where it is 
Cloud: "It's got nothing to do with us. Let's just leave it." 
Aerith: "Cloud……" 

(Cloud continues. Along the way, he climbs a pile of rubble and comes 
across a hidden room. A miner lives there.)  
: "Hey! How'd you ever wind up around here?" "Look, I'm sorry but, I can't do a thing for you!" "Oh boy!! Corel sure has gone to pot. It used to be a famous coal 
mining town!" "They say there were more jobs than you could shake a…" "Well, you get the picture!" "Now, it's nothing but a miserable pit! Me, my bulldozer… 
everything's out of work." "Got no job… I can't even show my face. 'Bout all that's left 
for me is to just live in this hole all day." 
(Can't help? Not so. Cloud grabs some treasure from his room and 
continues. Crossing a long suspended bridge across a deep gorge, he 
arrives in North Corel.) 
   
North Corel Barret's Hometown 
(Cloud arrives in North Corel. Barret approaches several people there, 
some dressed in mining outfits. One steps forward and punches him, then 
steps back.) 
"Well, lookey here! Never thought I'd ever see your face again." 
"They kick you out of another town or somethin'?" "You destroy everything you touch." 
"You got a lot of balls comin' back here!" "Look at this place! It's all your fault North Corel turned into 
a garbage heap!" 
"Why doncha say something!?" "Or did ya forget what you done here already?"
 
Barret: "…I'm sorry…." 
"^%$#! You ain't even worth the effort." 
"Don't waste your time talkin' to the Techno-freak!" 
 
Barret: "You heard 'em… It's my fault this town was… destroyed…" 
 
People in North Corel 
"YOU know who's responsible for North Corel winding up like this!" 
"The next train's coming in soon." 
"Grandpa used to be a coal train engineer." "He still can't kick his old habits from then." 
"Get out of the way!!" "The only way we can make ends meet around here now is by 
collecting junk!" 
"Please buy something! Anything will do!"  
"What do you want?" 
Buy: Listen to your story: Not interested 
Cloud: Buy 
 
Cloud: Listen to your story 
"Take that road on the left to the Ropeway station!" "The Roadway'll take you to the Gold Saucer." "It don't mean much to the poor folks though…" 
Cloud: Not interested 

"If you want to survive, then you're gonna need some of my 
weapons."  
"I hear it's a big fad now in the city to get tattoos. Is that 
right?" 
I wouldn't know: That's right 
Cloud: I wouldn't know 
"Really…? I saw a big '1' on the arm of a young guy heading 
towards the Ropeway. That Black Cape he had on was really cool." 
Cloud: That's right 
"I guess I should get a '0' tattoo! For a poor man like me, '0' 
oughtta be perfect." 

"Yaaay!! What do you wanna play?" 
"Because of them…… ugh my husband got into that accident…. 
He used to be such a strong man…" 
"How am I supposed to continue living in a town that's lost 
everything…?" "To hell with the Mako reactor!" 
 
Aerith: "Barret, what happened?" 
Barret: "Sorry." 
Cloud: "What happened?" 
Barret: "My hometown used to be around here." 
Red XIII: "What do you mean, 'used to'?"
Barret: "It ain't here no more. Heard it got buried… in just 4 years." 
Aerith: "But how could those people say those terrible things?" 
Barret: "An' it's my fault. ALL my fault." 
(The  fades. It changes to a shot of Corel, many years ago. Idyllic. 
A cat and dog play with a young child. Barret speaks over the scene.) 
Barret: "Corel was always a coal mining
town." "It's so dusty, but calm and so poor… a real small town, this 
one." "That's the first time I ever heard the word "Mako reactor" 
mentioned since that time…" 
(The  changes again. We are now at the village headman's house. Many 
people are gathered there, including Barret. Scarlet, with two of her 
bodyguards, is standing near the door as if she just walked in. Dyne is 
sitting on the couch. The village headman walks over to him.) 
Village headman: "What are we going to do? The only one against this is Dyne." 
Dyne: "I am definitely against it, no matter what. There's nothing to 
talk about if you're thinking of throwing away our coal!" "Our coal's been protected for generations. Our fathers, and 
theirs before them, risked their lives for it." "We have no right to throw it all away so easily!" 
Barret: "But listen, Dyne. No one uses coal nowadays. It's the sign of 
the times." 
Scarlet: "Right, everything is Mako, now." "It'll be all right, Dyne. Shinra, Inc. will guarantee your 
livelihood once the Mako Reactor is completed." 
Barret: "Listen. Dyne. I don't want my wife, Myrna, to suffer anymore." 
 
Dyne: "I know how you feel! I feel the same way too, damn it!" "But even so, I won't give away our coal mines!" 
 
Village Headman: "Dyne… you've got to understand." 
(Dyne looks at the village headman, then at Barret. He holds his head and 
starts to cry. The  fades darkly, but not to black. Barret speaks.) 
Barret: "That's how the Corel Reactor was built…. and completed." "We all thought it would bring us an easier life."
(The  fades to black. When it fades in again, we see the town of 
Corel in flames. One person falls four stories from a water tower. As the 
camera pans across the town, we see various townsfolk panicking, then 
dying.) 
Barret: "It happened when Dyne and I were out of town for a few days." "Corel was burned down by the Shinra troops." "All the townspeople…….. All my relatives……… 
Everyone…… Everything……" 
(The  fades to black. We are now back at the Ropeway station. Cloud 
walks around to Barret.) 
Cloud: "Shinra troops? What for!?" 
 
Barret: "There was an explosion at a reactor." "Shinra blamed the accident on the people. Said it was done by a 
rebel faction." 
Tifa: "That's so terrible!" 
Barret: "Well, I guess that's true. But more than Shinra, I couldn't 
forgive myself." "Never should have gone along with the building of the reactor…" 
Tifa: "Don't blame yourself. We were all fooled by the promises Shinra 
made back then." 
Barret: "That's way… that's why I get so pissed off!!" "Not only did they take advantage of me… But I lost my wife, 
Myrna, too…" 
 
"Hey everyone! If you want to go to the 'Gold Saucer', hurry and 
get on!" "Ride the Ropeway?" 
Go on: Don't go on 
Cloud: Go on 
Cloud: Don't go on 

Barret: "Dyne was my best friend. We was close ever since we was kids…" 
 
   
Gold Saucer Cait-Sith, The God Of Luck -
(Cloud and the others take the Ropeway to the Gold Saucer. FMV sequence 
as the Ropeway approaches. It is a huge golden structure, resembling 
something out of Star Wars, dotted with lights that shine and strobe 
happily. The Ropeway pulls into the station and Cloud gets off.) 
Chocobo: "Welcome to the Gold Saucer." 
 
"Welcome to the Gold Saucer." "Are you together? A single pass is 3000 gil, or you can purchase 
a lifetime pass for 30000 gil." 
Pay 3000 gil: Pay 30000 gil: Don't pay 
Cloud: Pay 30000 gil 
"Thank you very much." "If you have a Gold Ticket, you can come and go freely into the 
park… as long as you don't lose it." 

"Here at the Gold Saucer, there are many places where you must 
pay with GP." "Just think of 'GP' as money that you can only use at the Gold 
Saucer." "GP can only be redeemed at the games in Wonder Square and at the 
Chocobo Races." "Your GP limit is 10000, so please be careful." "Please enjoy yourselves." 
 
Aerith: "Wow! Let's have fun!" 
 
Aerith: "I know this isn't the right time to do this." 
 
Aerith: "Hey, Barret, cheer up!" 
 
Barret: "I ain't in no cheery mood. So jes'
leave me alone." 
 
Aerith: "Really? That's too bad." 
 
Aerith: "Let's go!" 
 
Tifa: "…whisper… whisper… " 
Aerith: "…whisper… whisper… " 
Tifa: "…whisper… " 
Aerith: "Of course!" 
 
Aerith: "We're gonna go play…" 
 
Barret: "So PLAY! …messin' round #@^%$!" "Don't forget we're after Sephiroth!" 
 
Aerith: "…I think he's mad." 
Tifa: "He'll be fine. He seems to be doing a little better now." 
(Cloud chooses who he wants to take with him into the Saucer. I chose 
Aerith.)
People in the Event Square 
"What's your problem? Can't you see we wanna be alone?" 
"Geez, you're a real bummer. Why don't you leave us alone?" 
"We put on a really unusual show here. It's not on today, but 
come back again sometime and see it." 
People in the Speed Square 
Man: "Hey boy." 

Cloud: "Boy…" 
Man: "How is it? You having fun?" "Mmm, so you ARE having fun. Well, good, good for you boy." 
Cloud: "My name's Cloud. And stop calling me boy." 
Dio: "Mmm? Me? I'm the owner of the Gold Saucer. The name's Dio." "Just call me 'Dio'." 
Cloud: "………" 
Dio: "By the way, boy, do you know what a 'Black Materia' is?" 
I know what it is: What is it? 
Cloud: What is it? 

Dio: "Ha ha ha…. that, I say, that's a good one, boy! But it's not 
good to lie. You can't fool me." 
Cloud: "Why d'you ask me?" 
Dio: "Well, a while back, a boy your age came in and asked me if I had 
a 'Black Materia.'" "I thought you might know who he was, seein' as how you're both 
about the same age." 
Cloud: "Did he happen to have… a Black Cape…" 
Dio: "Why yes, yes indeed. And a tattoo on his hand that said '1'." 
Cloud: "Where did he go!?" 
Dio: "Ha ha ha, I have no idea." "Well then." "I say, stop by the Battle Arena if you like, boy." "You'll probably like it. Many of my collections are on display 
there." "Ha, ha ha." 
 
"We have to be careful of these steps." "What…? A lot of things…" 
"First, I gotta memorize the order it comes out, and then guess 
on the attacks…… mumble, mumble….." 
"Hear the rules for this attraction?" 
Yes: Not interested 
Cloud: Yes
"This attraction, Shooting Coaster
is" "While your ride's going ZOOM, you're going BANG BANG, and things 
are going PHEW PHEW amd you destroy them with a big BOOM. Pretty simple, 
isn't it?" "Oh, to shoot, hit the O button. And, the Bar that's shown on the 
left side of the screen is the Power Meter." "When it's full, it'll go BROOOOOM and when it's empty, it'll 
only go BRM and become weak. So be careful." "Also, if you're in the Top 3 you'll get on the Wall of Fame." 
Cloud: Not interested 

"This attraction costs 10 GP." 
Pay: Changed my mind 

"Would you like to see the Wall of Fame?" 
Yes: Not interested 
Cloud: Yes 
 
"You'll receive a prize if you get more than 3000 points. So good 
luck." 
Cloud: Not interested 

People in the Round Square 
"Welcome. This attraction is 3 GP.
"Shall you be riding this evening?" 
Yes, I shall: No, I shan't 
<//>
People in the Ghost Square 
"Welcome. Thank you for coming to the Ghost Hotel." "Uuuuuuuuuugh….." "For reservations, please step up to the counter." "Uuuuuuuuuuugh…" 
"It's our most popular employee, Mr. Hangman." 
Mr. Hangman: "Welcome!" "It's 5 GP a night. Would you like to stay?"
Yeah, all right: No thanks 

People in the Battle Square 
"I'm sorry, we're currently renovating. Please come again." 
(Cloud goes to the Wonder Square. When he arrives, a… stuffed cat riding 
a giant moogle approaches.)
"Hey you!! What're you lookin' so down for!?" "How 'bout it? Want me to read your fortune!? A bright future! A 
happy future!" "Oh, but don't hold it against me if it's not a great prediction!" "Oh, so sorry! I'm a fortune telling machine. The name's…" 
 
Cloud: "You can only read the future?" 
Cait-Sith: "You kidding!? I can find missing things, missing people, 
anything!" 
Cloud: "Then can you tell me where a man named Sephiroth is?" 
Cait-Sith: "Sephiroth, right?" "Okay, here goes!!" 
 
Cloud: "…Ordinary luck. It will be an active fortune." "Give into the good will of others, and something big'll happen 
by summer. …wait… what's this?" 
Cait-Sith: "Huh? Let me try again." 
 
Cloud: "Be careful of forgetfulness. Your lucky color is… blue?" "…Forget it." 
Cait-Sith: "Wait, wait give me another chance!" "Wait! Let me try it again!" 
 
Cloud: "…What the!?" 
Aerith: "What?" 
Cloud: "What you pursue will be yours. But you will lose something dear." 
Cait-Sith: "I don't know if it's good OR bad…" "This's the first time I ever got something like THIS." 
 
Cait-Sith: "Then shall we?" 
Aerith: "What are you talking about?" 
Cait-Sith: "As a fortune teller, I can't help but think about this." "If I don't see what it leads to, I won't be able to relax. 
That's why I'm going with you!" 
Aerith: "What are we going to do, Cloud?" 
Cait-Sith: "I'm comin' with you no matter WHAT you say!" 
 
Cloud: "H… hey!"
People in the Wonder Square 
"Come now, no running!" 
"They probably told you at the entrance, but most of the 
attractions at Gold Saucer only take 'GP'." "They don't sell GP. You can only get 'em from the Wonder Square 
games or at the Chocobo Races." 
"You have ." "Exchange your GP for prizes here. Want to exchange?" 
"Nope. I'm not quitting until I clear this!"
"Hyuuuu, BAM, BAM, BAM…" "Oh man, I just gotta shout." 
"…Don't worry 'bout me. Go ahead and play." 
"I get so caught up in these…" 
"Back there…" 
 
This is Mog's House. It's in Mog Forest on Mt. Mog. The beginning of another day in the life of a Mog. 
 
This year, Mog is pipapopupo years old. …that's about 23 in 
human years. He's at that age when he should be looking for a mate. But before Mog can become an adult, he first needs to learn how 
to fly. 
 
Even though Mog trains hard everyday… He still can't seem to 
get off the ground… 
(Mog flaps his wings, leaps off the mushroom… and lands flat on the 
ground.) 
Looks like he's still got a long way to go… Here's where you come in. Help Mog learn how to fly by pushing 
the O button and feeding him his favorite Kupo nut. But don't overfeed him. He won't be able to fly if he's too fat. 
(Here you feed him some Kupo nuts… 5 to be exact. He jumps up on the 
mushroom again) 
Oh? It seems like Mog's decided to take another shot at it. 
(He flaps his wings, jumps off, and starts flying! He flies around for a 
while, then comes in for a landing.) 
He did it! He's flying! Now he's finally become a full-fledged 
Mog. 
 
Tired but relaxed, our little Mog turns out the lights early and 
goes to bed. Good night, and sweet dreams… 
 
Oh?… What's this? Here comes a female Mog! 
(She knocks on Mog's door. He answers it, and when he sees Miss Mog, he 
starts jumping up and down.) 
Seems like he likes her too… 
 
Now, will Mog be able to fly gracefully in front of her? Help him 
out with a few Kupo nuts. 
 
Oh? It seems like Mog's decided to take another shot at it. 
 
He's flying!! Mog was able to do it!! 
 
She must have fallen for his graceful flying form. 
 
Sometime later… 
 
Looks like things are going good with his new Mog-friend. Time 
for a quiet date in the forest. Her name is Mag. She is a good-natured Mog. 

Best of luck to the both of you, Mog and Mag. May you have lots 
of healthy Mogs! 
 
Uh, no worries there, I guess… 
 
~FIN~ 
"Hmmm…I'm impressed. Thanks for showing me it." "Here, take this." 
 
People in the Chocobo Square 
"Go---!! Do it----!! That's it----!!"
"Welcome to Chocobo Racing." 
"I'm sorry, but this is for authorized personnel only." 
"You can only buy up to 3 tickets. Think before you buy. For 
example, you could select half of the Chocobos and buy three boxes." 
Boxes? Not interested 
Cloud: Boxes? 
"A box is buying 3 combinations of 2 Chocobos." "For example, if you select Chocobo 1, 3, and 5, you can purchase 
combinations, such as 1-3, 1-5, 3-5." "You can also play the limited wheel by selecting a Chocobo." 
Limited wheel? Not interested 
Cloud: Limited wheel? 
"Playing a 'Limited wheel' means you select a Chocobo and use it 
in all of your combinations." "For example, if you have Chocobo 1, then you buy 1-2, 1-3, 1-4." "No matter how you make your bet, you win some and you lose some. 
It all comes down to insight and luck." 

"We usually buy tickets for the B rank and C rank races, right?" 
Rank? Not interested 
Cloud: Rank? 
"In other words, 'rank' means the Chocobo's 'strength'. A is 
highest and C's the lowest." "When you become a Free Chocobo jockey, you'll be able to buy A 
rank tickets." "Of course, the higher the rank, the better the item ticket. Hey, 
maybe I'll become a Chocobo 
jockey!?" 
How DO you become one? Not interested 
Cloud: How DO you become one? 
"You can become one if you own a Chocobo… and have some 
connections. But Chocobo's are pretty hard to catch and I don't have any 
connections." 

"Hey, what's that Chocobo on the odds sheet?" 
"That's how you can find out a Chocobo's condtion and strengths." 
"Hmm, if you can tell which ones are the strongest, then it's 
easy…" 
"Well, not as easy as you think. It's not just a matter of the 
Chocobo's strength." "but it also depends on the jockey and the Chocobo's 
personality." "If these are bad, they may use too much stamina, and affect 
other things." 
"Welcome. Would you like to buy some Chocobo tickets?" 
Yeah: Explain it to me: Not interested 
Cloud: Explain it to me 
"This Chocobo Race has Virtual devices on the course." "They show natural scenery during the race that really doesn't 
exist." "You pick which Chocobo will finish first and second here." "And then buy the appropriate tickets." "And if the ticket you purchased is a winner, you'll receive a 
ticket for an item that will be listed on the panel." "You can exchange your tickets for items of GP at the exchange 
counter to the right of the entrance." 

   
Barret's Crime -
(Cloud goes to the Battle Square. When he arrives, he sees a guard 
standing at the foot of the steps.) 
Cloud: "!!" 

Cloud: "Mm!?" 
 
Cloud: "Dead….." 
Aerith: "What!? Why?" 
 
Aerith: "Cloud!? Where are you going?" 
(The others follow him. When they arrive in the lobby, they find the floor 
covered in blood and debris. There are many bodies scattered around.) 
Cloud: "Did Sephiroth do this!?" 
 
Cloud: "No… it's not him… They're all shot… Sephiroth would never 
use a gun…" 
"Ugh, ugggh." 
 
Cloud: "Hey, what happened!" 
"Ugh… ugh… a man with a gun… on his arm…." 
Aerith: "It can't be!?" 
"Hold it right there! And stay quiet!!" 
 
Dio: "Did you guys do this!?" 
Cloud: "N… no, it wasn't us!" 
Dio: "I must've been wrong…" 
 
Cait-Sith: "Hurry and run, it's gonna get ugly." 
 
Cloud: "H… hey!" 
 
Dio: "Hold them!" 
(They arrive in the arena. There is no way out. Dio emerges on a high 
platform.) 
Dio: "That's as far as you go." 
 
Cloud: "Wait, listen to…" 
 
Cait-Sith: "Cloud…" 
(Three huge robots leap into the arena and approach them. The screen fades 
to black. When it fades in again, we are at the "Gateway to Heaven." It is 
just a hole in the floor. One of the robots is holding Cloud over it.)
Dio: "One more to go." 
"Yes." 
Cloud: "Hey! Pay attention!!" 
Dio: "There's no need to listen. Pay for your crime down below!!" "Do it!" 
"Yes."

(A guard presses a button, opening the 'Gateway.' The robot, still 
holding Cloud, leaps down. The screen fades.) 
   
Corel Prison -
 
Aerith: "You all right?" 
Cloud: "Where are we?" 
Cait-Sith: "A desert prison… Corel Prison…" 
Cloud: "A desert prison?" 
Cait-Sith: "Yup, a natural prison in the middle of the desert… surrounded 
entirely by quicksand." "I heard that once you get in, you never get out…." "But, there was one special exception…" 
(The camera pans down. We see Barret standing near some pipes. There is a 
man lying face down on the ground near him.) 
Aerith: "Hey!! Barret!!" 
 
Cloud: "Barret…" 
 
Cloud: "Did he really….." 
 
Barret: "Stay back! This's something I gotta deal with." 
 
Barret: "Jes' leave me alone…." 
 
Cait-Sith: "Whew! That's one of your friends? He sure looks dangerous…" 
Aerith: "Cloud, what should we do? Barret's not his normal self." 
 
Cloud: "This one's been shot too…"
People in Corel Prison 
"Wo-ho! Welcome to Corel
Prison." 
"Ha ha ha" 
"I'll tell you one thing, rookie. This desert is extremely 
dangerous." "It'll welcome you in, but when you try to leave, it'll 
swallow ya." "I hear tell, some of them never make it out… the best thing is 
to stay out of the desert entirely."
"Those guys only tell lies. Only lies. Not a one of 'em will tell 
you the truth." "Just talk with 'em a couple of times, and you'll get sick of 
them."
"This place is heaven." "This place is heaven." "This place is heaven." "Man with a gun on his arm?" "Never heard of him." "Never heard of him." "Never heard of him." "You wanna see the Boss?" "Go Southwest and you'll meet him." "You'll meet him." "You'll meet him." "Once out in the desert, stay still and don't walk." "Don't walk." "Don't walk." "There's no way you'll ever see a mysterious Chocobo carriage. 
No way." "No way." "No way." 
"This elevator will talk you to the top…" "But, you gotta be picked a s Chocobo racer, first." 
"Want to enter the Chocobo Race?" 
Not interested: Yeah, I want to enter 
Cloud: Not interested 
"You thinkin' of livin' here forever? Then live a long life!" 
Cloud: Yeah, I want to enter 
"Then go get permission with the boss of this place." 
Cloud: "Who's the boss?" 
"You don't even know that? Oh man." 

"You new? Then go and pay your respects to Mr. Coates." 
Mr. Coates: "Never seen your faces 'round here before. Goin' up?" 
Not interested: Yeah, up 
Cloud: Not interested 
Mr. Coates: "Heh heh! You sure got guts!" 
Cloud: Yeah, up 
Mr. Coates: "You don't seem to understand how things work down here." "This is the Gold Saucer's garbage dump. And that makes alluv ya 
scrubs." "The only way to get back up there is to win the Chocobo Race." "But, it's not as easy as you rookies think." "Of course, if you got the boss's premission it'd be a different 
story but, YOU'll never get that!"
"Ha ha ha ha." 

   
Gun Arm -
(Cloud enters a small shack on the edge of the prison. As he enters, we 
see that it is the same house we saw during Barret's story, only it is 
rundown and sooty, ravaged by fire. Barret bursts in the door.)
Barret: "Didn't I tell you not to come here!?" 
 
Cait-Sith: "Ju….. just hold on for a second! We just want to talk! You'll 
understand if you just hear us out!" 
(Barret fires. Cloud and the others lift their arms and try to protect 
their head, but they are not hurt. Barret continues to fire… A person 
falls to the ground. He was hiding behind the couch. They lower their arms. 
Barret turns away.)

Barret: "Didn't want none of ya to get involved…" 
 
Aerith: "Hey that's Cloud's line! '…It's too dangerous, I can't let you 
get involved…' blah, blah, blah…" 
Tifa: "Yeah. We're already involved in this." "We saw you and hurried here. So come on Barret, just tell us 
what's going on." 
Barret: "You guys…" 
Red XIII: "I heard that the murders at the Battle Arena were done by a man 
with a gun-arm. …Was that you?" 
 
Barret: "There's another…. another man that got a gun grafted inta one 
of his arms… It was four years ago…." 
(The screen fades white. When it comes in again, we are at the train 
tracks that join the Mako reactor they passed on the way to Corel.) 
I remember… I was on my way home from visiting a Mako Reactor 
being built. 
(Barret and Dyne come across the train tracks when the village headman 
rushes up from the direction of North Corel.) 
"Barret! Dyne! Come quick! The village's being attacked! It's 
Shinra soldiers!" 
Barret: "What!!!?" 
(Barret and Dyne leap off the track and run to the cliff's edge. They see 
their village, in flames. Black smoke rises into the sky. Barret raises 
his arms and trembles.)
Barret: "What the hell happened? ……." 
(Barret falls to his knees. Dyne looks away. Barret punches the ground 
and Dyne shakes his shoulder.) 
Dyne: "Hey, Barret! It's not over yet!" "Everyone's waiting! Let's go back to the village!" 
(The  shifts back to the train tracks. Four Shinra soldiers come 
onto the tracks and aim their guns at the village headman.) 
"Barret! Dyne! Protect the village!" 
 
Barret: "Hmp!! Old man!!" 
(They start firing at Barret and Dyne. Dyne leaps under the tracks, but 
Barret is left dancing his way though their fire.) 
Dyne: "C'mon, Barret! We gotta hurry!" 
 
Barret: "Krggh!!" 
(He follows Dyne. When he reaches him, they stop, standing at the edge of 
a high cliff. Scarlet enters and stands by the guards, still firing.) 
Dyne: "Barret!! You stay here!!" 
Scarlet: "Kyaa haa, ha!!" "You can shoot all day and never hit them with an aim like that." 
Barret: "Shu'up!!" 
(Scarlet knocks one of the guards off the tracks. The rest stop firing 
and face her.) 
Scarlet: "Haa, ha, ha!! Stop playing around and cover me!!" 
 
Dyne: "Watch out!!" 
(They hit Dyne, who falls from the cliff. Barret grabs his left arm just in 
time to save him from falling.) 
Barret: "Dyne!! Hang on!!" "Lissen to me!! You're comin' back the the village, hear!!?" 
Dyne: "Yeah… I ain't lettin' go…" "You're comin' back… Everyone's waitin' for ya…" "Eleanor… and Marlene… They all waitin' on us…"
(FMV sequence. The guards continue to fire. Their fire sweeps along the 
edge of the cliff, hitting Dyne's and Barret's arms. Dyne falls from 
Barret's grasp, into the chasm. The  fades back to the house in Corel 
Prison.) 
Barret: "From then on, I couldn't use my right arm no more." 
 
Barret: "…I was depressed for a while." 
 
Barret: "But then I threw away my artificial arm and got this gun grafted 
in." 
 
Barret: "Got a new right arm to get revenge on the Shinra, who took 
everything away…" 
 
Barret: "Back then, I heard the doc say there was another man who got 
the same operation as me." "But, his was the left arm…" 
Cloud: "….." 
Aerith: "But… Dyne's injury was the same as yours, right?" 
Tifa: "Yeah, that's right. He was deceived by the Shinra too." "He'll probably join us to fight against the Shinra." 
Barret: "…wouldn't bet on it. I gotta 'pologize to Dyne before I can 
rest in peace." "An' that's why, I gotta go alone." 
Cloud: "Do whatever you want… Is that what you want to hear?" "Well, I can't let you do it. Because, if you die on me, I'm 
gonna have nightmares." 
Aerith: "Barret, this isn't the end." "Weren't you going to save the Planet?" 
Barret: "Shit! Tifa, you oughtta know by now." 
Tifa: "…That's all right. I'm not so different from you." 
Aerith: "That's easier to understand. It's you, Barret." 
Cloud: "So there it is, Barret. So I guess it'll be Barret, me, 
and……" 
  
   
Dyne Broken Trust -
(Cloud, Barret, and the others travel north from Corel Prison to the 
junkyard. At the north side of the junkyard, they meet Dyne, who his 
shooting his gun-arm at random things. The ground is littered with debris, 
and the gives way at a cliff's edge into a deep gorge. There are two 
crosses, one large and one small, crudely stuck into the ground by the 
cliff's edge.) 
Barret: "…Dyne …. Is that you?"
 
Dyne: "Now that's a voice I haven't heard in years…" 
 
Dyne: "A voice I'll never forget…" 
Barret: "I always hoped I'd be able to see you again someday…" "I knew you were alive somewhere… we had the same operation." "Listen to me Dyne. I want to…" 
 
Dyne: "What's that? …I hear her voice." 
Barret: "……?" 
Dyne: "I hear her voice, Eleanor's voice. Begging me… not to hate 
your rotten guts." 
 
Dyne: "That's why I didn't hunt you down…" 
Barret: "I know I was stupid. I'm not asking you to forgive me." "But… What're you doin' in a place like this?" "Why ya wanna kill those that ain't even involved? Why?" 
 
Dyne: "….Why!? The hell do you care for!?" 
 
Dyne: "Are the people killed going to understand 'why'? Are the people 
of Corel going to understand just hearing Shinra's excuses?" 
 
Dyne: "I don't CARE what the reason is!" 
 
Dyne: "All they give us are artillery and stupid excuses… What's left 
is a world of despair and emptiness…" 
Barret: "…….." 
Dyne: "You still want to hear 'why'? …All right, I'll tell you." 
 
Dyne: "'Cause I want to destroy everything." 
 
Dyne: "The people of this city." 
 
Dyne: "This city itself." 
 
Dyne: "The whole world!" 
 
Dyne: "I got nothing left in this world. Corel, Eleanor…… 
Marlene……" 
Barret: "Dyne, Marlene…… Marlene's still alive." 
 
Dyne: "……..?" 
Barret: "I went back into town. I thought she was gone for sure." "That is why I wanted to be by her side till the end." "That's when I found her….. …found Marlene." 
Dyne: "…" 
Barret: "She's in Midgar. Let's go see her together, all right?" 
Dyne: "So…… she's still alive…" "All right, Barret. I guess that means you and I gotta fight." 
Barret: "What!?" 
 
Dyne: "Eleanor's alone all by herself. I've got to take Marlene to her." 
Barret: "Dyne…. are you insane!?" 
Dyne: "Marlene wants to see her Mom, don't she?" 
(Dyne starts firing directly at Barret. Barret tries to block the bullets 
with his arms) 
Barret: "Stop, Dyne! I can't die yet!" 
 
Dyne: "Oh yeah? Well my life's been over ever since then." 
 
Barret: "Stop it! I don't wanna fight you!" 
 
Cloud: "Barret!" 
Barret: "Cloud, you stay the hell out of it! This is MY problem!!" 
 
 
Dyne: "Back!!" 
(He gets up and limps over near the cliff's edge. He leans against a 
piece of broken metal.) 
Dyne: "…it wasn't just my arm…… back then…." "I lost something irreplaceable. I don't know where I went 
wrong…" 
Barret: "Dyne….. I don't know either, man." "Is this the only way… we can resolve this?" 
Dyne: "I told you… I… I want to destroy everything…" "Everything… This crazy world… Even me…" 
Barret: "An' what about Marlene? What's gonna happen to her!?" 
Dyne: "Think about it… Barret… How old was Marlene back then…?" "Even if I did go to her now… she wouldn't even know me…" "And what's more… Barret…." 
 
Dyne: "These hands are a little too stained to carry Marlene anymore…" 
 
Barret: "……" 
Dyne: "Barret…" 
 
Dyne: "Give that pendant to Marlene… It was… Eleanors's… my 
wife's… memento…" 
Barret: "All right…" 
Dyne: "…wow… Marlene's… already….. 4……" 
(Dyne limps over to the cliff's edge. Many rays of sunlight break through 
the clouds overhead, striking the ground below the two crude crosses.) 
Dyne: "Barret…. Don't… make… …..Don't ever make Marlene….. 
cry…" 
Barret: "Dyne…?" 
 
Barret: "Dyne!" 
 
Barret: "Dy--------ne!!" 
 
Barret: "…Dyne. Me an' you were the same…" "My hands ain't any cleaner…. I shouldn't be able to carry…. 
Marlene either…." "Uuuuurrrrgghh!!!" 
(The camera pans upwards, showing Barret raising his arms to the sky. The 
sun shines on the forest in the distance. The screen fades to black.)  
   
Ester, Your New Manager 
 
Mr. Coates: "You want somethin'?" 
Barret: "I want to go up." 
Mr. Coates: "Like I told you before, you gotta get the Boss' permission, then 
win the Chocobo….." 
Barret: "Dyne's got his reasons an' can't speak." "So, I got this instead." 
 
Mr. Coates: "Yeah, bull--!!" 
Barret: "I want to go up." 
 
Mr. Coates: "R, right." "Did you kill Dyne?" "You must've. Or you'd never be holding that thing." "So Dyne's dead… Maybe now, the place'll calm down a little." "Dyne didn't care who anyone was……" 
 
Barret: "The hell do YOU know!!" 
Mr. Coates: "R… ri…. right! I mean, no, I DON'T know anything. 
S, s… sorry." 
 
Cloud: "Then, will you get us outta here?" 
Mr. Coates: "Huh? Oh man, you guys are mistaken." 
 
Mr. Coates: "I already told you, there's only one way to get outta here." "That's to win the Chocobo Race and that's help up there, in the 
Gold Saucer." "And, only one racer can go up at a time." 
 
Barret: "Say what!?" 
Mr. Coates: "Nooo! Really, even if you threaten me!!" "A rule's a rule. I can't change it." "If I do, the whole system down here'll get messed up!! An' I 
can't do that!" "Okay, ok, I'll let one go up there. After that, he's gotta deal 
with Dio." 
 
Barret: "Awright then." 
 
Barret: "Cloud, you go." "We'll wait down here." "Hurry up an' win that Chocobo Race, an' get us outta here!" 
Aerith: "Yes, good luck, Cloud." 
Mr. Coates: "Have you decided?" "All you need now is a manager." "…and register and get a Chocobo…" 
"Hi…… I happened to hear your story." 
 
Mr. Coates: "Ester?" 

Ester: "I'll be your manager." 
Mr. Coates: "Well, I have nothing against it, but…." "This is Ester. She may look kinda funny…" "But there's no better manager in the races." 
Ester: "That's so rude…" "Yeah, well. Nice to meet you, Cloud." 
Mr. Coates: "All right then, Cloud." "I'll send you up on the elevator. Ester'll fill you in on the 
details."  
   
Chocobo Race Free -
 
Ester: "Hmm, so that's what happened. I'll talk to Dio directly. You 
just concentrate on the race." "Oh yeah, getting back to the other thing, there are many 
different types of Chocobo jockeys. It's not only for criminals." "Some people compete for the fame, some people compete for the 
money, some only for glory… And then there are people like you." "Oh yeah, I'll teach you how to ride a Chocobo." 
All right: Not interested 
Cloud: All right 
Ester: "Ummm… First use the [Select] button to choose either AUTO or 
MANUAL." "In other words, either you control the Chocobo or let it run on 
its own." "But it's pretty hard to make the Chocobo run the way you want it 
to. If the Chocobo doesn't like you, it won't listen." "You can't really help on this one." "But, most of the Chocobo's that I'll provide you with are mellow 
and you should be able to handle them." "When you're riding, use the Square button to Speed Up and the X 
Button to Slow Down." "But, it you go faster than the Chocobo can handle, it'll lose 
its stamina really fast." "And use the Directional button to move the Chocobo left and 
right, use the O button to get a boost of speed." "Of course your stamina runs out faster though." "There are some bad-tempered Chocobos that can't pace themselves 
and they'll lose their stamina pretty fast." "For there kinds of Chocobos, you should set the controls on 
Manual and slow it down." "Finally, some advice for the restless, once the first and second 
Chocobo cross the goal line," "Push the [Start] button to end the race." 

 
Man: "You new?"
Ester: "Hi, Joe." 
Joe: "Hey, Ester, you're looking pretty as usual." 
Ester: "Thanks." "Let me introduce you, Cloud." "This is Joe, one of the top Chocobo Jockeys." 
Joe: "Nice to meet you, Cloud." "If you're with Ester, then…" 
Ester: "Right! He's an up and coming jockey." "He's only been down here for a day and already he made it up 
here!!" 
"What!?" 
Joe: "Oh, I see…" "So what did you do down there?" "Sorry… you're not supposed to ask about the past here…" "Pretty interesting…. I have a feeling that we'll meet again." "Then, until we meet again, Cloud." 
 
Ester: "I'm going to check on the Chocobo. You just wait here for a 
while." 
 
"The race will start in a few moments. Will the jockeys for the 
next race, please proceed the the paddock." "I repeat…" 
 
Ester: "Cloud." 
 
Ester: "Thanks for waiting. I registered you in the next race." "This is a Chocobo I prepared myself. He won't lose easily." "Oh yeah… You know how to ride one?" 
Uh, how was it again? Yeah, I got it 
Cloud: Yeah, I got it 

Ester: "Then, good luck." 
 
Ester: "Congratulations!! Now you're home free!" "Oh yeah, the owner told me to give this letter to you when you 
won." 
Dio: "Boy, if you're reading this letter, then you must have won. And 
won a victory that I am sure you earned." "I heard about Dyne from Ester. Now that you are victorious, I 
promise that you and all your friends will get a full pardon, and you will 
all be set free." "And also, by way of apology, I prepared a little gift for you to 
use on your journey." "Sorry I couldn't be there to tell you this in person, but I'm a 
very busy man. Sincerely, Dio" 
Cloud: "A gift?" 
 
Aerith: "Cloud, isn't this great!? The assistant manager just stopped by 
and dropped off a 'buggy' for you!" "Now you can go over 'deserts' and 'rivers' no problem." "OK, Cloud. I'll be waiting outside." 
Cloud: : "P.S. I just recently met Sephiroth. He must have a lot of fans 
with boys your age." "Why don't you get his autograph? It seems he's headed toward the 
South of the river, towards Gongaga."
Cloud: "Sephiroth…" 
Ester: "I guess this is goodbye." "Yeah. Well, if you ever get your
own Chocobo, come race again." "I'll take care of your registration
and everything. I'll see you again." 
(Cloud exits the Gold Saucer and drives
south on his new buggy, towards
Gongaga.) 
   
The Turks Ruined Reactor Gongaga Village Aerith and Zack -
(Cloud and the others arrive in the Gongaga area. Cloud approaches an 
intersection along the forest path leading to the town, then stops.) 
Cloud: "Is someone there?" 
 
Reno: "Hey, Rude. Who do you like?" 
 
Reno: "What are you getting so embarrassed about? Come on? Who do you 
like?" 
Rude: "………..Tifa." 
Reno: "Hmmmm……." "That's a tough one." "But, poor Elena. She…. you……" 
Rude: "No, she likes Tseng." 
Reno: "I never knew that! But Tseng likes that Ancient…" 
 
Cloud: "What are they talking about?) 
 
Elena: "It's so stupid!" "They always talk about who they like or don't like. But Tseng is 
different." "Ah! Oh no!" 
 
Elena: "They're here! They're really here!" 
Reno: "Hmm… Then it's time…" "Rude… Don't go easy on them even though they're girls." 
Rude: "…Don't worry, I'll do my job." 
Elena: "Then, we're counting on you. I'll report to Tseng!" 
 
Reno: "It's been a while." "Payback time for what you did in Sector 7." 
Sector 7? Out of our way 
Cloud: Sector 7? 
Reno: "That's sad." 
Cloud: Out of our way 
Reno: "I don't like being taken for a fool."

Rude: "That's as far as you go." 
 
Aerith: "…How could they know we were coming here?" 
Cloud: "They followed us…… But there weren't any signs of it. Then, 
that means……" 
Tifa: "A spy!? …No way." 
 
Cloud: "I don't even want to think that there's a spy…." 
 
Cloud: "I trust everyone." 
(Cloud goes up one path to a reactor in the distance. The surrounding 
area is littered with massive chunks of steel debris, and the reactor 
itself stands in ruins, as if blown apart.) 
Cloud: "A ruined reactor." 
 
Cloud: "It's Scarlet, Head of Shinra Weapon Development."
(He hides behind the reactor. Scarlet and Tseng approach. Scarlet pokes 
around in the rubble.) 
Scarlet: "…..Hmph! This isn't any good either." "You only get junky materia from junky reactors." 
 
Scarlet: "This reactor's a failure." "What I'm looking for is big, large, huge materia. You seen any?" 
Tseng: "No, I haven't seen it. I'll get on it right away." 
Scarlet: "Please. We could make the ultimate weapon if we only had some." 
Tseng: "I just can't wait." 
Scarlet: "With Hojo gone, the Weapon Development's been getting a bigger 
budget." 
Tseng: "I envy them." 
Scarlet: "But, even if we make the perfect weapon, could that stupid 
Heidegger ever use it?" 
Tseng: "….." 
Scarlet: "Oh… sorry! I forgot Heidegger was your boss! Ha ha ha!" 
Tseng: "….." 
Scarlet: "Let's go!" 
 
Cloud: "…Big, large, huge materia?" "An ultimate weapon? The perfect weapon?" "Just what are the Shinra up to…?" 
(The camera pans down to show Scarlet and Tseng getting into the 
helicopter, which takes off. Cloud grabs the materia Scarlet passed up, 
Titan, and heads back to the intersection and down the other path. It 
leads to Gongaga town. As Cloud enters, the camera pans up to show the 
ruined reactor we already visited.) 
Cloud: "A ruined reactor…." 
People in Gongaga  
: "…………." 
"Three years ago when the reactor exploded, my husband…." 
"Huh….. did you want something?" 
Buy accessories? Hear a story? Nothing in particular 
Cloud: Buy accessories? 
 
Cloud: Hear a story? 
"People can live without the Shinra's Mako Reactors." 
Cloud: Nothing in particular 
"They sell the weapons on the second floor. Climb up the pole to 
get there." 
<//>
"…You want something?" 
Buy weapons? Hear a story? Nothing in particular 
Cloud: Buy weapons? 
 
Cloud: Hear a story? 
"Shinra built the reactor, without even thinking about the town's 
safety. And, this is the result." 
Cloud: Nothing in particular 

"Oh… you here to shop?" 
Buy items? Hear a story? Nothing in particular 
Cloud: Buy items? 
 
Cloud: Hear a story? 
: "It's been a while since the explosion, but you can still find 
pieces of it left all over town." "Shinra built the reactor, without even thinking about the town's 
safety. And, this is the result." "One day, there was a huge explosion. Many townspeople died in 
it…" 
Cloud: Nothing in particular 

"This is Gongaga Village. Many people died here in a Mako reactor 
explosion." "The Shinra people told us that everyone would be happy once the 
Reactor was built. But, all it brought us was sadness…" 
"Uh… need somethin'?" 
Need a room? Hear a story? Nothing in particular 
Cloud: Need a room? 
"It's 80 Gil a night." 
Cloud: Hear a story? 
: "It's been a while since the explosion, but you can still find 
pieces of it left all over town." "Shinra built the reactor, without even thinking about the town's 
safety. And, this is the result." "One day, there was a huge explosion. Many townspeople died in 
it…" 
Cloud: Nothing in particular 

(Cloud enters a house near the southern edge of Gongaga. A man gets up 
from a chair inside.) 
"You a traveller? Hey wait, that glare in your eye… you in 
SOLDIER?" 
 
"Oh you're right! Don't you know anything about our son?" 
"His name is Zack." 
"It's been close to 10 years since he left for the city, saying 
that he didn't want to live in the country…" 
"He left saying he's going to join SOLDIER. You ever hear of a 
Zack in SOLDIER?" 
Cloud: "Hmmm… I don't know." 
 
Aerith: "Zack…" 
"Young lady, you know him?" 
"I remember he wrote us 6 or 7 years ago saying that he had a 
girlfriend. Could that have been you?" 
 
Aerith: "That can't…" 
 
Tifa: "Zack…" 
 
Cloud: "What happened to you two?" 
 
Cloud: "Aerith…" 
Aerith: "What a shock….. I didn't know Zack was from this town." 
Cloud: "You know him?" 
 
Aerith: "Didn't I tell you? He was my first love." 
Cloud: "…………" 
Aerith: "Zack…. SOLDIER First Class. Same as Cloud." 
Cloud: "Strange, there aren't that many who make First Class, but I've 
never heard of him." 
 
Aerith: "That's all right. It's all in the past now. I was just worried 
because I heard he's been missing." 
Cloud: "Missing?" 
Aerith: "I think it was 5 years ago. He went out on a job, and never 
came back." "He loved women, a real lady's man. He probably found someone 
else…" 
 
Aerith: "Hey? What's wrong?" 
Poor guy:  
Cloud: Poor guy 
Aerith: "I don't really mind that I haven't heard from him. But I feel 
for his parents." 
Cloud:  
Aerith: "Are you… jealous? Hmm? Hmmm? Are you, Cloud?" 
 
Aerith: "I'm kidding. I'm sorry." 

Aerith: "Let's go, Cloud." 
 
Tifa: "Zack……" 
Cloud: "Do you know him?" 
Tifa: "N, no, I don't know him!" 
Cloud: "Your face tells me differently." 
Tifa: "I told you, I don't!" 
Cloud: "A, all right." 
 
Tifa: "……….." 
 
Tifa: "That sounds just like you, leaving town, and saying 'I'm joining 
SOLDIER!'." 
Cloud: "There were a lot of guys like that back then." 
Tifa: "You must really be something making it in SOLDIER out of a group 
like that." "I really respect you…" 
I just got lucky: I worked hard for it 
Cloud: I just got lucky 
Tifa: "Don't be so humble!" 
Cloud: I worked hard for it 
Tifa: "Hard work pays off, huh." 

Tifa: "Cloud, thanks for caring." 




   
Cosmo Canyon Grudge -
(They board the buggy and head northeast, to Cosmo Canyon. Right outside 
the town, the buggy begins to spark.)
"!?" 
 
Cloud: "Oh man… a breakdown? Now?" 
(They enter the town of Cosmo Canyon. At the entrance, Red XIII comes 
bounding up and speaks with the gateman.) 
Red XIII: "I am home! It is I, Nanaki!" 
"Hey, Nanaki! You're safe!" "Come on, and say hello to Bugenhagen!"
 
Cloud: "…Nanaki?" 
Aerith: "Cosmo… Canyon? I wonder if there's any relation to the planet 
or the Ancients…" 
Tifa: "Red XIII seems different, doesn't he?" 

"Welcome to Cosmo Canyon. Are you familiar with this land?"
Yes: No 
Cloud: Yes 
Cloud: No 
"Let me explain." "People from all over the world gather here to seek the Study of 
Planet Life." 

"Ummgah! It's full capacity at present, so I'm afraid I can't 
let you enter." 
 
Red XIII: "They helped me some when I was on the road. Please let them in." 
 
"…Oh, is that so? You helped our Nanaki? Please, come in." 
Cloud: "Who is Nanaki?" 
"Nanaki is Nanaki. That's his name." 
People in Cosmo Canyon 
"Welcome to Cosmo Canyon. Make yourselves at home." 
"So this is Cosmo Canyon… Quite a mysteious place." 
"Have you come to seek the 'Study of Planet Life'?" 
That's it: No 
Cloud: That's it 
"Yeah? I heard there's an awesome observatory here. I'd like to 
see it if I have a chance." 
Cloud: No 
"Oh yeah? What? The car broka down?" "Why don't you look around Cosmo Canyon, while I fix the car?" 
<//>
"Whoa!" "Don't scare me like that. I almost fell over." 
"Yaay! Nanaki! Nanaki's back! It's all thanks to this flame!" "This fire is called 'Cosmo Candle.' It has burned for 
generations." "It's a holy flame that protects this canyon." "I heard once, it only went out once, long ago." "The elders said something horrifying occurred, but I really 
don't know much about it." 
Elder Bugah: "Is that so? You brought Nanaki back here?" "Yeah, thanks." 
"Welcome. How 'bout our original cocktail, 'Cosmo Candle?'" "A drink now and then is good for you. It'll relax you a bit. 
…If you know when to stop." 
"Welcome to 'Shildra Inn'." "It'll be 100 gil a night. Would you like to stay?" 
"Hello. Looking for anything in particular?"  
"Oh, welcome." "The people of this canyon hate to compete. So almost everything 
here are replicas." "But that's all right. Some of them you really can use." 
Elder Hargo: "Where did I put it…? I know it's around here…" 
"Bugenhagen sealed this door shut." "How'd he do that? With super glue?" 
"Oh man, I'm so busy. I need more help. Mummer… complaint…" 
"…num… yawn… Sir,… You… forgot….. your… ..change." "…num…. Yes, I'm coming." "Are you here to shop?" 
Yes, that's right: No, what's your problem? 
Cloud: Yes, that's right 
"Oh… is that so… You're here to shop?" "I'm sorry! We hardly ever get any customers so…. Oh, but I DO 
have confidence in our materia!"  
Cloud: No, what's your problem? 
"Oh… is that so…. then leave me alone and let me…. yawn…. 
sleep…." 

 
Red XIII: "Here is where I was…. I mean, …this is my hometown." "My tribe were protectors of those who appreciate this beautiful 
canyon and the Planet." "My brave mother fought and died here, but my cowardly father 
left her……. I am the last of my race." 
Cloud: "Cowardly father?" 
Red XIII: "Yes. My father was a wastrel." "And so the mission I inherited from my ancestors, is to protect 
this place. My journey ends here." 
"Hey! Nanaki--! You're home!" 
Red XIII: "Coming, Grandpa!" 
 
Tifa: "That's perfect. Why don't we take a break too? We can meet back 
here in a while, OK?" 
  
   
Bugenhagen's Observatory 
(Cloud travels to the very top of Cosmo Canyon. He enters the shack there. 
Red XIII and Bugenhagen are waiting.) 
Red XIII: "Cloud, this is my grandfather, Bugen." "He is incredible. He knows everything." 
Bugenhagen: "Ho Ho Hoooo. I hear that you looked after Nanaki a bit." "Nanaki is still a child you see." 
Red XIII: "Please stop, grandfather. I'm 48." 
Bugenhagen: "Ho Ho Hoooo. Nanaki's tribe has incredible longevity." "So you see his 48 years would only be equivalent to say that of 
a 15 or 16 year old in human reckoning." 
Cloud: "15 or 16!?" 
Bugenhagen: "He's quiet and very deep. You thought he was an adult?" 
 
Red XIII: "…….grandfather. I want to be an adult." "I want to grow up to be able to protect you and the village." 
Bugenhagen: "Ho Ho Hoooo. No Nanaki. You can't stand on your own yet." 
 
Bugenhagen: "To do that now would destroy you in the long run." 
 
Bugenhagen: "Reaching up into the heavens, threatening to snatch the very 
stars from the great city of Midgar. You're seen it, haven't you?" 
 
Bugenhagen: "Well, that's a bad example. Looking up too much makes you lose 
perspective."
 
Bugenhagen: "When it's time for this planet to die, you'll understand that 
you know absolutely nothing." 
Cloud: "…..When the planet dies?" 
 
Bugenhagen: "Ho Ho Hoooo. It may be tomorrow, or 100 years from now… But 
it's not long off." 
Cloud: "How do you know this?" 
 
Bugenhagen: "I hear the cries of the Planet." 
(There is a loud sound, resembling a whale song, very guttural, and 
natural. The camera pans up to the top of the house, showing the 
observatory there.) 
Cloud: "What's that?" 
Bugenhagen: "Tha sounds of the stars in the heavens. While this goes on, 
planets are born, and die." 
(There is a much louder sound, mixing with the others, much like the 
others, but.. mournful, painful.) 
Cloud: "What was that?" 
 
Bugenhagen: "Ho Ho Hoooo. That was a scream from this planet." "Didn't you hear it? As if to say… I hurt, I suffer….." 
 
Red XIII: "They have come here on a journey to save the planet." "Why don't you show them your apparatus?" 
 
Bugenhagen: "Ho Ho Hoooo. To save the planet? Ho Ho Hoooo!" 
 
Bugenhagen: "But, then again, I guess it wouldn't hurt to show him." 
"Bugenhagen!" 
 
"Several odd looking people have come." 
Bugenhagen: "The whole place has gotten busy all of a sudden." 
Red XIII: "He brought friends too. I'll go get them." 
 
Red XIII: "Cloud, please call one of them." "Only three people can fit in grandfather's machine." 
Bugenhagen: "Don't worry. My machine won't run away. You go and invite your 
friends." 
  
   
The Lifestream 
 
Bugenhagen: "Here, over here. The door's unlocked, come on in." 
 
Bugenhagen: "Ho Ho Hoooo. It looks like you have them all together. Then 
let's begin." "I'll stand there." 
(FMV sequence as Bugenhagen activates the elevator. It takes them to the 
upper level, where there is a model of the solar system.)
Aerith: "So pretty… It's just like the real thing!" 
 
Bugenhagen: "Hmm, yes pretty good. This is my laboratory." "All the workings of space are entered into this 3D Holographic
System." 
 
Aerith: "Hey! A shooting star!" 
(FMV sequence. A shooting star rockets past Aerith, followed by a glowing 
orb, and several meteors. All of these are sucked into a black hole in the 
corner.)
Aerith: "Wow, how wonderful." 
Bugenhagen: "Ho Ho Hoooo. Yes, it is something, isn't it?" "Well, let's get to the subject." "Eventually… all humans die. What happens to them after they 
die?" "The body decomposes, and returns to the Planet. That much 
everyone knows. What about their consciousness, their hearts and their 
souls?" "The soul too returns to the Planet." "And not only those of humans, but everything on this Planet. In 
fact, all living things in the universe, are the same." 
 
Bugenhagen: "The spirits that return to the Planet, merge with one another 
and roam the Planet." "They roam, converge, and divide, becoming a swell, called the 
'Lifestream'." "Lifestream…. In other words, a path of energy of the souls 
roaming the Planet." 
 
Bugenhagen: "'Spirit Energy' is a word that you should never forget." "A new life… children are blessed with Spirit energy and are 
brought into the world." "Then, the time comes with they die and once again return to the 
Planet…" "Of course there are exceptions, but this is the way of the 
world."
"I've digressed, but you'll understand better if you watch this." 
(FMV sequence. The camera zooms in on model Earth. We see trees and humans 
being born, then die. Their bodies becomes masses of swirling light, then 
streak across the surface of the Earth, merging. On the other side of the 
planet, the energy forms into a new being. Streaks of energy cover the 
planet, glowing many colors. Bugenhagen floats over to the planet.) 
Spirit energy makes all things possible, trees, birds, and humans. 
 
Not just living things. But Spirit energy makes it possible for 
Planets to be Planets. 
 
What happens if that Spirit energy were to disappear? 
(The energy is all drawn into Bugenhagen's sleeve. When it is all gone, the 
planet turns jet-black, and crumbles, huge chunks floating off into space. 
The camera returns to the party.)
Bugenhagen: "……These are the basics of the Study of Planet Life." 
Cloud: "If the Spirit energy is lost, our Planet is destroyed…" 
Bugenhagen: "Ho Ho Hoooo. Spirit energy is efficient BECAUSE it exists within 
nature." "When Spirit energy is forcefully extracted, and manufactured, it 
can't accomplish its true purpose." 
 
Cloud: "You're talking about Mako energy, right?" 
Bugenhagen: "Everyday Mako reactors suck up Spirit energy, diminishing it." "Spirit energy gets compressed in the reactors and processed into 
Mako energy. All living things are being used up and thrown away." "In other words, Mako energy will only destroy the Planet…" 
(The elevator lowers again. Bugenhagen and the others are lowered to floor 
level.) 
Bugenhagen: "The story of the planets… and those who lived with them…." "You want to know more? Then you must listen to the words of the 
elders." 
   
Cosmo Candle 
(Cloud leaves the shack and goes down to the Cosmo Candle. The others are 
all waiting there. He sits down and talks to each one.) 
Aerith: "I learned a lot. The elders taught me many things." "About the Cetra… And the Promised Land…" 
 
Aerith: "I'm…… alone….. I'm all alone now…" 
Cloud: "But I'm….. we're here for you, right?" 
 
Aerith: "I know. I know, but… I am the only…. Cetra." 
Cloud: "Does that mean we can't help?" 
 
Cait-Sith: "I wonder how many years it's been… Gosh, it brings back 
memories……" 
Barret: "Cosmo Canyon… This's where AVALANCHE was born…" "I promised my guys someday… when we saved the planet from the 
Shinra, that we'd all go to Cosmo Canyon and celebrate…" "Biggs… Wedge… Jessie…" "Now they're all gone… died for the planet." "…Really? To save the planet?" "We all… we all hate the Shinra…" "Do I even got to go on?" "Will they…… …will they ever forgive me?" 
 
Barret: "…Right now, I really don't know. But I know one thing." "If there's anything I can do, to save the planet… or the 
people livin' on it… Then I'm gonna do it!" "I don't care if it's for justice or revenge, or whatever. I 
don't care….. let 'em decide for 'emselves." 
 
Barret: "Urrrrrgh! I'm gonna do it!!" "Again…. Again…. AVALANCHE's born again!" 
 
Tifa: "Cloud…" "Bonfires are funny, aren't they?" "They make you remember all sorts of things." 
 
Tifa: "You know, Cloud. 5 Years ago…" 
 
Tifa: "………It's nothing." 
 
Tifa: "No, forget it. I'm afraid to ask…" 
 
Cloud: "What is it…?" 
Tifa: "It feels like… It feels like you're going far away…" 
She looks at him) 
Tifa: "You really, really are….. you… right?" 
 
Red XIII: "……Long ago." "…When I was still very small. We were all around this flame…" 
 
Red XIII: "No, never mind…" 
Cloud: "What happened?" 
Red XIII: "It's about my parents." "When I talk about my mother, I am full of pride and joy…" "And that's fine. …But when I remember my father, my heart is 
full of anger…" 
 
Bugenhagen: "…You really can't forgive your father…?" 
Red XIII: "Of course. He… left mother for dead." "When the Gi tribe attacked, he ran off by himself, leaving 
mother and the people of the Canyon!" 
 
Bugenhagen: "…Come, Nanaki. There's something you should see." 
Red XIII: "…?" 
Bugenhagen: "The place may be dangerous." 
 
Bugenhagen: "Cloud. Will you and one other person come with us?" 
  
   
Nanaki, Son Of Seto 
 
Bugenhagen: "Ho Ho Hoooo" "Are we all set?" 
Just a minute: Yeah 
Cloud: Just a minute 
Bugenhagen: "Not ready yet? Tell me when you are ready." 
Cloud: Yeah 
Bugenhagen: "Ho Ho Hoooo. Shall we go?" 

 
Bugenhagen: "All right. Come in, come in." 
Red XIII: "Hey? Aren't you going with us, Grandpa?" 
 
Bugenhagen: "What are you crazy? It's dangerous in there. I told you that!" "You want an old man like me should go first? I'll be right 
behind you." 
(They enter the door. Climbing down a long series of ropes and ladders, 
they reach the bottom of a long tunnel. Traversing a cave, they reach a 
doorway, where Bugenhagen speaks.)
Bugenhagen: "Ho Ho Hoooo." "Everyone here's a Ghost of the Gi tribe. Killed in a certain 
battle." 
Red XIII: "A certain battle?" 
Bugenhagen: "The vengeful spirits of the Gi didn't disappear, and couldn't 
return to the Lifestream…" "We still have far to go. Ho Ho Hoooo."
 
Bugenhagen: "As you can see, this cave leads to the back of Cosmo Canyon." "It was unfortunate that the Gi were larger than us. If they 
attacked though here, we wouldn't have stood a chance." 
Red XIII: "………." 
Bugenhagen: "Let's move on." 

Bugenhagen: "This warrior went through the cave all alone." "Fighting attackers one after another…" 
Red XIII: "Grandpa…….. That warrior…." 
Bugenhagen: "Ho Ho Hoooo… We're almost there." 
(In the next cave, they find a huge, grotesque statue on the wall, 
surrounded by lava.)

Bugenhagen: "What is this…..?" 
Red XIII: "Grandpa, is he…!?" 
Bugenhagen: "After death… The ghosts of the Gi… Like stagnant air….." "This… can't be!!" 
 
Bugenhagen: "Thank you, Cloud. Because of you, we survived." "Nanaki, you have grown strong too." 
Red XIII: "…….Oh yeah?" 
Bugenhagen: "Now I know that it wasn't a mistake bringing you here…" "Come, I have something I want to show you. Right over here." 
(They all file into the next room. There is a huge pile of boulders 
surrounded by fog in the center. Red XIII leaps onto it.)
Red XIII: "This is…" 
Bugenhagen: "…The warrior who fought against the Gi." "He kept them from taking even one step into Cosmo Canyon." 
 
Bugenhagen: "But he was never able to return to town…"
 
Bugenhagen: "Look, Nanaki. Look at your father, at the warrior, Seto." 
(The camera pans upwards. We see a stone figure of one of Red XIII's tribe 
atop a high cliff. The moon glows red in the sky. FMV sequence as the 
camera swings around the figure.) 
Red XIII: "…That… That's…. Seto?"
Bugenhagen: "Seto continued to fight the Gi tribe here. …To the protect 
this Canyon." "Even after the Gi's poisonous arrows turned his body to 
stone……" "Even after they all ran away… Seto, continued to protect us." "And he continues to protect us, even now." 
Red XIII: "Even now…" 
 
Bugenhagen: "You thought that he was a coward and ran away. But he, alone, 
risked his life to protect Cosmo Canyon." "That is your father, Seto." 
 
Red XIII: "That….. that is Seto? …!? Did mother know?" 
Bugenhagen: "Ho Ho Hoooo… She knew. The two of them made me promise to keep 
this cave shut." "They asked me to seal it myself and not to tell a soul." "Thay said we should forget about this cave." 
 
Red XIII: "………" 
 
Bugenhagen: "Cloud….. Would you mind leaving the two of us alone?" 
 
Bugenhagen: "Nanaki, I want you to continue your journey with Cloud and the 
others." 
Red XIII: "Grandpa!?" 
Bugenhagen: "Listen, Nanaki." 
 
Bugenhagen: "Cloud says they are trying to save the planet." "Honestly, I don't think it can be done." "For even if they stop every reactor on the planet, it's only 
going to postpone the inevitable." "Even if they stop Sephiroth, everything will perish." 
 
Bugenhagen: "But, Nanaki. I've been thinking lately." "I've been thinking if there was anything WE could do." "As a part of the planet, something to help a planet already in 
misery…" "No matter what happens, isn't it important to try?" "Am I just wishing against fate?" 
 
Bugenhagen: "I am too old to do anything about it…" "This year, I'll be 130. Ho Ho Hoooo." 
 
Bugenhagen: "That is why, Nanaki, you must go with them! For my sake." 
 
Red XIII: "Grandpa…" 
 
Bugenhagen: "I wanted to show you your real father before you left…" "I'm so glad that you came back while I was still alive to show 
you." 
 
Red XIII: "Grandpa… don't talk like that. I don't want to think of 
life… without you….." 
 
Bugenhagen: "Ho Ho Hoooo. Well, I've had a long life." 
 
Red XIII: "Grandpa! You must live!" "I'll see to it." "I'll see to what's happening to the planet. And I'll come back 
to tell you." 
 
Bugenhagen: "Nanaki…" 
 
Red XIII: "I am Nanaki of Cosmo Canyon! The son of the warrior, Seto!" "I'll come back a warrior true to that noble name! So please, 
Grandpa…" 
(Red XIII looks up. The camera pans up; small drops of water are falling 
from above.) 
Bugenhagen: "That's… Seto's….. Seto….."
Red XIII: "Seto… Fa… Father…." 
(Red XIII leaps to the highest point on the rock structure and howls up to 
the moon, and Seto. The camera pans up to show Seto, tears falling from 
stone eyes.)

Red Truth 
 
Barret: "They said they finished fixin' the buggy." 
 
Cloud: "Shall we get giong?" 
Aerith: "So this is it, Red XIII…" 
 
Barret: "That's just the way it goes. …You came in handy at times…" 
(Cloud chooses his party and everyone leaves. On the way out of Cosmo 
Canyon, Red XIII comes running.) 
Red XIII: "Wait for me! I'm coming too!" 
Cloud: "Mmm?" 
 
Bugenhagen: "Cloud. Please look after Nanaki." 
Cloud: "What happened?" 
Red XIII: "I think I grew up a little. That's
what happened!" 
(Red XIII runs off. Cloud and the others leave Cosmo Canyon, board the 
buggy, and head west, towards Nibelheim.) 
   
Nibelheim Revisited The Black Cloak -
(Cloud and the others board the buggy and head north, to Nibelheim. They 
arrive in the central courtyard.) 
Tifa: "What---!!" 
 
Tifa: "This was all supposed to be burnt down, right?" 
 
Cloud: "I thought so." 
Tifa: "Then why…? My house is still there too…" 
Aerith: "…something's strange?" 
Cloud: "I'm not lying!" 
 
Cloud: "I remember… the intense heat of the flames…" 
People in Nibelheim 
"Hi, welcome." 
Give me a room: What's your story? 
Cloud: Give me a room 
"It'll be 100 gil a night. Is that all
right with you?" 
Cloud: What's your story? 
Cloud: "This town was supposed to have burnt down five years ago." "What the hell is going on?" 
"Sir, don't say such awful things." "I was born and raised in this town. What you say never happened." 
Tifa: "You're lying…" 
"EXCUSE ME….. That's so rude…" "If you're going to talk like that to me, I'm going to have to 
ask you to leave." 

"Nice town, huh?" "We've been in business here for a long time…." 
Cloud: "…You're lying." 
"Do you have anything to do with this town?" 
How about bein' born and raised here? Nope, guess not 
Cloud: How about bein' born and raised here? 
Cloud: "I was here until I was 14 and I don't remember you." 
"It's not nice to lie!!" 
Cloud: Nope, guess not 
Cloud: "…nothing." 
"Oh yeah…?" 

Cloud: "A man in a black cape!?" "He has a tattoo of the number '12'. Mmm? He has something." 
 
"Can……. you…… hear? The… voice… of… Se… phi… 
ro… th……." 
"What is it?" 
Nothing: I want to hear your story 
Cloud: Nothing 
"Oh, really. Then, it'll help me too." 
Cloud: I want to hear your story 
Cloud: "I lived in this house until I was 14…" "No, but this town was burned down." 
"Are you sick… saying those things?" "Get out of here!" 

"…must….. get….. it… and bring… to… Se… phi… 
roth…." "Then… become… one… with… Se… phi… roth…" 
Cloud: "This guy's number '5'…" 
Cloud: "He has a tattoo of the number '11'…" 
 
"…must…….go… Reun… ion…" 
Cloud: "Tattoo number '4'" 
 
"…Where… are… you…? Great… Se… phi… roth…" 
"………………." 
 
"….Re…. union." 
"………ion" 
"The… Great… Se… phi….. roth… is… near….." "In… side…… inside… the Mansion…… Urrrrrrgh……. 
the great….. Sephi….. roth" 
"Wooooo-----ooow…… He's… calling…… Sephiroth……… 
is……… calling……" 
  
   
Calamity From the Skies -
(Cloud enters the Shinra Mansion. Taking the hidden passage in the 
fireplace, they head down to the library in the basement. Cloud stops in 
the hallway. Sephiroth stands at the other end.) 
Cloud: "Sephiroth!" 
Sephiroth: "Being here brings back memories." "Are you going to participate in the Reunion?" 
Cloud: "I don't even know what a Reunion is!" 
Sephiroth: "Jenova will be at the Reunion. Jenova will rejoin the Reunion 
becoming a calamity from the skies." 
Cloud: "Jenova, a calamity from the skies? You mean she wasn't an 
Ancient!?"
Sephiroth: "…I see. I don't think you have the right to participate." "I will go north past Mt. Nibel. If you wish to find out… then 
follow…" 
Cloud: "…Reunion? Calamity from the skies?" 
(Sephiroth throws a green materia at Cloud, then rises into the air and 
shoots past Cloud, out of the library. Cloud picks up the materia a 
Destruct materia. He leaves the library and Shinra mansion.) 
   
Rocket Town Hey, Cid! 
(Cloud heads north, to Mt. Nibel. Traversing narrow pathways and a twisted 
cave through it, they emerge on the other side of the mountain range. They 
arrive at Rocket Town.) 
Cloud: "What's that…!?" 
(The camera pans up to show a rocket, tilted quite badly in its launch 
platform.) 
Cloud: "A rusty old rocket… Wonder what they'd make something that 
huge for?"
People in Rocket Town 
"Better ask the Captain about this town. He's the one in charge 
of it." 
Captain? Did you see a man in a Black Cape? 
Cloud: Captain? 
Cloud: "Who's the 'Captain'?" 
"The Captain was a pilot when Shinra was still interested in 
their Space Program." "He was going to be the world's first astronaut, but there was an 
accident…" "Ever since then, he's been wasting his life away here dreaming 
about going into outer space." 
Cloud: Did you see a man in a Black Cape? 
Cloud: "Did you see a man in a Black Cape?" 
"A man in a Black Cape? Nope… don't know a thing about it." 

"Everyone in this town was a mechanic back when they were 
planning to launch the rocket." 
"That rusted old rocket is all that remains of the Shinra's Space 
Program." 
"This used to be a Shinra base where they used to launch rockets." "You saw the leaning rocket, right? That's Shinra No. 26. It never 
got off the ground though." 
"A gun is a MAN's weapon! Ain't nuthin' else'll do!" (Sells 
weapons)
"Welcome to the Shanghai Inn!" "It's 100 gil a night. Would you like to spend the night?" 
"Would you like something to drink?" 
Let me hear your story: Not interested 
Cloud: Let me hear your story 
"Did you meet the Captain already? He's really the town's 
representative, so you should really talk with him." 
Cloud: Not interested 
"……that's too bad. Please come again." 

"A drink will ease your heart…" 
"…I'm in here." 
"Welcome! This is the Item Shop."  
"All gramps does is gaze at that rocket all day long." 
"My job's to make everyone laugh all over the world…"
(Cloud goes through a house and enters the back yard. There is a large 
pink plane there) 
Cloud: "There's a Shinra logo on it. Tiny Bronco….. This is cool." 
Aerith: "Let's take it! OK, Cloud!" 
 
"Um… may I help you?" 

Cloud: "No… We're just looking at it." 
"…If you would like to use it, please ask the Captain. The 
Captain should be in the Rocket." "I'm Shera. And what are your names?" 
Cloud: "I'm Cloud." 
Aerith: "I'm Aerith." 
Tifa: "Tifa. Nice to meet you." 
Shera: "Hmm…. So you're not with the Shinra." "I thought the approval for the reopening of the Space Program 
came." 
Cloud: "……!?" 
Shera: "President Rufus is scheduled to come here. The Captain's been so 
restless all morning." 
 
Cloud: "Rufus!!?"
(Cloud leaves the house and heads north, to the rocket. Climbing ladders 
and traversing platforms, he reaches the interior of the rocket, where a 
gray-haired man in a flight jacket is working on some mechanics.)
"What're you guys doin' here?" 
Cloud: "We heard the Captain was here." 
 
"Captain? I'm the Captain!" 
 
Cid: "The name's Cid. Everyone calls me, 'Captain,' though." "What d'ya want?" 
Tell me about this rocket: Is Rufus coming? Can we borrow the "Tiny Bronco?" 
Cloud: Tell me about this rocket 
 
Cid: "Wow! Not bad for a kid." "Alright then, I'll explain it to you." 
 
Cid: "You know Shinra developed a lot of techological gadgets during 
the meaningless war, right?" "Now it's a Mako company, but in the old days it was a weapons 
manufacturer." 
 
Cid: "Well, they came up with a Rocket Engine." "There was so much excitement about the thought of going into 
outer space. Our dreams got bigger and bigger." "They put a major budget into it and made prototype after 
prototype! Finally, they completed Shinra No. 26." "They chose the best pilot in Shinra- no, in the world- me. I 
mean, come on." 
 
Cid: "And finally we get to the day of the launch. Everything was 
goin' well…" 
 
Cid: "But, because of that dumb-ass Shera, the launch got messed up. 
That's why they became so anal!" 
 
Cid: "And so, Shinra nixed their outer space exploration plans." "After they told me how the future was Space Exploration and got 
my damn hopes up… DAMN THEM!" 
 
Cid: "Then, it was all over once they found out Mako energy was 
profitable. They didn't even so much as look at space exploration." "Money, moola, dinero! My dream was just a financial number for 
them!" "Look at this busted Rocket. I was supposed to be the first man 
in space with this." 
 
Cid: "Everyday, it tilts a little bit more." "At this rate, I don't know which will come first, this thing 
falling down or me gettin' outta here." 
 
Cid: "My last hope is to talk to the President……" 
Cloud: Is Rufus coming? 
Cid: "Yeah! It must be news about restarting the Space Program." "A young President, that's what we needed! He still has dreams, 
too!" 
Cloud: Can we borrow the "Tiny Bronco"? 
 
Cid: "You out of your *&$^$# mind!? That's my most cherished 
possession. I can't let you take it."

   
Sending a Dream Into the Universe Tiny Bronco Escapes! -
 
Shera: "Excuse me…. Cloud?" 
 
Shera: "Did the Captain say anything?" 
Cloud: "Nope…" 
Shera: "Oh…?" 
 
Cid: "^%$#! Shera. What are you, blind!?" "We got guests!! GET SOME TEA! ^%$#!" 
Shera: "I… I'm sorry." 
 
Cloud: "Really, don't mind us." 
 
Cid: "Shut up! Sit your ass down in that chair and drink your goddamn 
TEA!" "Arggggggh! DAMN, I'm pissed!" "Shera! I'll be in the backyard tunin' up Tiny Bronco!" "An' make sure to serve them some tea! All right!?" 
 
Aerith: "Sheesh…!! What bad manners!" 
Cloud: "Sorry. It's our fault." 
 
Shera: "No, no. He's always like this." 
Tifa: "Is it always like this…? Why is Cid so hard on you?" 
 
Shera: "No… It's because of my stupid mistake." "I was the one who destroyed his dream…" 
Cloud: "What happened?"
(The  fades to a view of a room in the rocket, lined with oxygen 
tanks; it is sepia-toned. Cid watches Shera work on one of the tanks.) 
Cid: "Hey! Get your ass in gear! You work like a snail!" "Even the moon'd get tired watin' around for your ass!" 
 
Shera: "I'm… I'm sorry." 
Cid: "Don't take so much time checkin' that *%$^# oxygen tank!" "Shera, bein' careful's good, but it won't do any good no matter 
how many times you check that oxygen tank." "That thing wouldn't break even if hell froze over." 
Shera: "But…" 
 
Cid: "No buts!!" "You're not stupid, so be more efficient!" 
Shera: "I'm sorry….."
(The  shifts. We are now at the room at the top of the rocket, where 
Cloud and Cid had their first discourse. Several men are running around 
working on the rocket. Cid comes in, sans flight goggles) 
"Captain! Our dreams are finally coming true!" 
"We are so proud to be a part of the launch of Shinra No. 26." 
"Captain, preparations are complete! All that's left is lift off!" 


Cid: "Yeah! Leave it all to me! I'll be back in a few!" 
"All right, Captain! Fly our dreams into outer space!" 
 
Cid: "Thanks, guys!" 
"We're praying for your safety!" 
 
Cid: "Instrument panel… all clear. Shinra No. 26, ready for launch." 
 
"Engine pressure rising. Shinra No. 26, 3 minutes to launch. 
Beginning countdown." 
Cid: "……….finally." 
 
Cid: "What the? What happened!?" 
"Cid! We have an emergency situtation!" "A mechanic is still in the engine section of the rocket!" 
Cid: "What!? Who is the little ^%$@!?" 
"I don't know. Activating the intercom in the engine section." 
(The  switches back to the oxygen tank room. Cid comes over the 
intercom) 
Cid: "Hey, goddammit!! Who the &%$#'s still in there?" 
Shera: "It's Shera, Captain. Don't mind me, go ahead with the launch." 
Cid: "Shera!? What are you still doin' in there!?" 
Shera: "I was still concerned. The results of the oxygen tank test 
weren't satisfactory." 
Cid: "You stupid little ^$#^%!" "It's gonna get so hot in there that there ain't gonna be SHIT 
left when we blast off!" "You're gonna be burnt to a crisp! You're gonna die! You know 
that, doncha!?" 
 
Shera: "I don't mind." "If I can just fix this, the launch will be a success. I'm almost 
done." 
 
Cid: "Almost done!? You're gonna die!" 
"Cid, we must start the countdown. We won't make it if we don't!" 
 
"Starting engine!" 
Cid: "Hey, wait a minute! Shera's still in here!" 
"What are you going to do, Cid? If we cancel now, it'll be 
another six months until the next launch!" 
Cid: "GODDAMMIT, Shera… you wanna make me a murderer?" 
 
Shera: "Captain!" 
Cid: "Shera!?" 
Shera: "Tank Number 7 check is complete. Once I complete Tank Number 8, 
it's all clear." 
Cid: "Come on, Shera… hurry up… You're gonna die…" 
"30 seconds until ignition. Beginning countdown." 
Cid: "Hey, wait a minute! Shera's still in here!" 
"Cid! Forget about her. We won't make it in time!" 
Cid: "What… what am I… What am I supposed to do…?" 
"15 seconds until ignition. Internal temperature rising." 
Cid: "Oh man, the moon… outer space… my dreams…" 
"Ignite engine!" 
Cid: "SH------------IT!" 
(He, resignedly, drops his arm and presses a button. FMV sequence. The 
rocket engine ignites, then stops within seconds. The rocket falls back 
down to earth, loses its balance, and tips over, coming to rest off-center 
in the launch platform. The  switches back to Cid and Shera's home.)
Shera: "He pushed the Emergency Engine Shut Down switch, aborting the 
mission, to save my life." "After that, the Space Program was cut back and the launch was 
canceled." "It's my fault his dream was destroyed…" 
 
Shera: "That's why… it's all right. I don't care what the Captain 
says, I'll live my life for him." 
 
Cid: "Shera! You still haven't served 'em tea!" 
Shera: "I… I'm sorry." 
(Shera rushes back to the stove. Cid crashes in a chair and hoists one 
leg up onto the table.) 
Cid: "Hurry up and sit down! Or ain't my hospitality good enough for 
you!?" 
 
Cid: "They're late… Where is Rufus…?" 
 
Palmer: "Hey-HEY! Long time no see! So Cid, how ya been?" 
 
Cid: "Well, if it ain't fat man, Palmer. How long were you figurin' on 
keepin' me waitin'!?" 
 
Cid: "So? When's the Space Program gonna start up again?" 
 
Palmer: "Hey-hey! I don't know. The President's outside, so why don't you 
ask him?" 
Cid: "^$#&! Good for nothing, fat &$#$^@!" 
 
Palmer: "Don't say 'fat'!" 
 
Palmer: "Hey-hey! Tea!" "Can I have some too? With lotsa sugar and honey and… oh yeah, 
don't forget the lard!" 
 
Cid: "What the…..! You got me all excited for nothing!?" "Then, what'd you come here for?" 
Rufus: "I want to borrow the Tiny Bronco." "We're going after Sephiroth. But it seems like we're been going 
in the wrong direction." "But now, we think we know where he's headed. But, we have to 
cross the ocean. That's why we want your plane…" 
Cid: "&^#^%! First the Airship, then the Rocket, and now, the Tiny 
Bronco." "Shinra took outer space away from me and now you want to take 
the sky away from me too!?" 
Rufus: "Oh my…" "You seem to forget it was because of Shinra, Inc. that you were 
able to fly in the first place." 
Cid: "What!?" 
 
Shera: "Uh, excuse me…" 
 
Shera: "This way…" 
 
Shera: "You wanted to use the Tiny Bronco, right?" 
 
Shera: "I believe Palmer's going to take it. Why don't you talk to him?" 
 
Palmer: "Hmm… Why do I have to do this…? I'm the head of the Space 
Program…" 
 
Cloud: "We'll be takin' that Tiny Bronco." 
Palmer: "I've seen you somewhere before…" 
 
Palmer: "I know! The Shinra building! When the President was killed! Ulp!" "Se… se… security!!" 

(After the battle, the Tiny Bronco fires up. Palmer narrowly escapes being 
scalped by the propeller, then runs away… he amost makes it, except he 
manages to get hit by a truck. Cloud and the others all jump onto the Tiny 
Bronco.) 
Tifa: "It won't stop!" 
Cloud: "Forget it! Get in!!" 
(FMV sequence. The Tiny Bronco takes off, loops around the rocket, and 
buzzes Rufus and his guards, who begin firing at the Bronco. Cid dashes to 
catch up with it and leaps onto the tail. The guards' fire hits the tail, 
which begins sparking.)
Cid: "Shit!! The tail's been hit!" 
Cloud: "Emergency landing…" 
Cid: "This's gonna be a big splash. Hold onto your drawers and don't 
piss in 'em!"
(FMV sequence as the Bronco makes a crash landing in the middle of the 
ocean.) 
   
Tiny Bronco Afloat 
(Cloud, Cid, and the others are aboard the Tiny Bronco, adrift in the 
ocean. Cid is lying with his head almost in the water, arms dangling.)
Cid: "She won't fly anymore." 
Cloud: "Can't we use it as a boat?" 
Cid: "$#&%! Do whatever you want!" 
Cloud: "Cid, what are you going to do now?" 
Cid: "Dunno. I'm history with the Shinra and I've given up on the 
town." 
Cloud: "How 'bout your wife? How 'bout Shera?" 
Cid: "Wife? Don't make me laugh! Just thinkin' 'bout marryin' her 
gives me the chills." "What're you guys gonna do?" 
Cloud: "We're going after a man named Sephiroth. We'll have to get 
Rufus of the Shinra someday too." 
Cid: "I don't know about any of that, but…" 
 
Cid: "What the hell!? Sign me up!" 
Cloud: "How 'bout it, everyone?" 
 
Tifa: "Of course, no problem!" 
Cid: "Glad to be aboard, numbskulls!" 
Cloud: "Numskulls…?" 
Cid: "Yeah. Anyone stupid enough to go up against Shinra nowadays, has 
GOTTA be a numskull! I like it!" 
 
Cid: "So, where we headed?" "Rufus was goin' after Sephiroth towards the Temple of the 
Ancients." 
Cloud: "Really!? …Where is it? That Temple of the Ancients?" 
Cid: "Dunno. That numskull kid was tellin' me he was headin 'the 
wrong direction'… so maybe it's off this way?" 
Cloud: "Let's just head for land and get some information. Temple of the 
Ancients… that name bothers me." 
 
   
The Keystone -
(Cloud and the others have gained the Tiny Bronco to wander about the 
world. At this point, the party can pretty much do what they please. 
Onward they journey. Cloud and the others travel to a small shack outside 
the Gold Saucer. A salesman inside walks over.) 
"Huh? Oh, another customer. You sure picked an out of the way 
place but…" "But if it's the "Keystone" you're looking for, you're too late. 
Don't have it." 
Cloud: "Keystone?" 
"What? You didn't come here for that?" "The "Keystone is the key that unlocks the gate to a very old 
temple somewhere." "You're not going to believe your ears," "But I heard it was the Temple of the Ancients!!" 
Cloud: "The Temple of the Ancients…" 
"Kya, hah hah hah…" "Don't take it seriously. It's just a legend!" 
 
"Huh? What?" 
Where is this "Keystone"? Where is the Temple? Let's change the subject: Never mind 
Cloud: Where is this "Keystone"? 
"I sold it already. Yeah well, to tell the truth, I didn't really 
want to sell it but…" "That guy had a way about him that made you feel like it may not 
be a good idea NOT to sell it to him…" 
Cloud: "Who did you sell it to?" 
"The manager of the Gold Saucer… think his name was "Dio". 
Said he was going to put it in his museum, then he took off out of here." 
Cloud: Where is the Temple? 
"Come on… it's only a legend. But if it were true, that sure 
would be something, huh?" "Now that you mention it, I have heard of something called 
Ultimate Destruction Magic" "was supposed to be hidden somewhere in the Temple of the 
Ancients." 
Cloud: "Ultimate Destruction Magic…?" 
"Come on! I told you not to take it seriously!" 
Cloud: Let's change the subject 
"All the weapons you see here I made myself. But lately I haven't 
been able to get materials…" 
Cloud: Never mind 
<//>
(Cloud travels to the Gold Saucer and goes to Dio's Show Room at the 
Battle Square. The Keystone is sitting on a pedestal in the center.) 
Cloud: "It's the Keystone…" 
 
Dio: "Heh, heh, heh. Long time no see, my boy. Hmm? You like that, 
huh?" 
Cloud: "Can you let me borrow this?" 
 
Dio: "Heh, heh, heh. Sorry, but it's not for rent." "Hmm." "Since you've been good to me in the past, I CAN let you have it 
on one condition." 
Cloud: "One condition?" 
 
Dio: "Heh, heh, heh. Entertain me!" 
What'd you want me to do? Not in the mood 
Cloud: What'd you want me to do? 
Dio: "Hoo boy!" "Heh, heh, heh. It's not something that's really difficult." "This is the Battle Arena. Show me your fighting skills. Just 
you, my boy, I'm expecting a good fight!" 
 
Cloud: Not in the mood 
Dio: "I see… Then let's pretend that this never happened." 

 
Dio: "That's the best you could do? Well, a promise is a promise. Go 
ahead, take it." 
 
Dio: "Well then, we shall meet again! Heh, heh, heh." 
   
Ghost Hotel Conversation 
(Cloud heads for the Station Square. A workman is standing outside the 
Ropeway) 
Staff: "Excuse me, sir." "I'm sorry. The Tram is out of order right now." 
Cloud: "…so?" 
Staff: "I'm really sorry!" "I'm afraid you won't be able to leave until it's fully 
repaired." 
 
Cait-Sith: "What's wrong?" 
 
Cait-Sith: "Too bad. It happens, though." "I know! Let's stay at the hotel! They know me here. I'll go 
talk to them." 
 
Staff: "I will let you know once the repairs are completed."
(The  shifts to later that night. The entire party is gathered in the 
lobby of the Ghost Hotel. Cid is dozing in a big comfy chair.) 
Cait-Sith: "We don't usually get the chance to be together like this, huh?" "Cloud, how 'bout it? Can you tell us what's happened so far?" "I don't really know what's gon' on because I wasn't here in the 
beginning." 
 
Cid: "Yeah! I'm all for it!" 
Barret: "I been here since the beginnin', an' I still don't know what the 
hell's goin' on either." "Cloud, the hell's goin' on? C'mon, tell us!" 
I'm tired… All right, I'll give it a shot… 
Cloud: I'm tired… 
Cid: "All we have to do now is sleep! You're still young! What're you 
complaining about?" 
Cloud: All right, I'll give it a shot… 
Cloud: "Phew…" 

Cloud: "We are going after Sephiroth." "Sephiroth must be in search of the Promised Land." 
Cid: "The Promised Land?" 
Cloud: "A land full of Mako energy, … or at least that's what the 
Shinra believe." "I don't know if it actually exists." 
Aerith: "The Cetras return to the Promised Land. A land that promises 
boundless happiness." 
Barret: "Cetra? That some kinda disease?" 
Aerith: "That's what the Ancients call themselves." "Hey, didn't you listen to the elders at Cosmo Canyon?" "…You don't 'know' where the Promised Land of the Ancients is." "You search and travel, until you feel it. Like you just know, 
'…this is the Promised Land.'" 
 
Cloud: "Aerith… can you feel it too?" 
Aerith: "I think so." 
Tifa: "So Sephiroth is traveling the world because he's searching for 
the Promised Land? Is that it?" 
Aerith: "That, and one other thing he's searching for." 
Cloud: "The Black Materia…" 
Cait-Sith: "I heard from Dio that a man in a Black Cape was lookin' for the 
Black Materia." 
Tifa: "I don't even know what the Black Cape is…" "How many men with Black Capes and number tattoos are there?" 
Red XIII: "…you know, of course… My tattoo is number 13." 
Cloud: "How did you get that tattoo?" 
Red XIII: "…Hojo put it on me. Everything else is just war scars, but the 
number was done by Hojo." 
Tifa: "So there are at least 13!?" 
Aerith: "…You know……" "I think Hojo did something to those men in the Black Capes." "But I don't know what it has to do with Sephiroth though…" "That's why I think we should just go after Sephiroth himself." 
Barret: "Yeah, me too! It's all just to damn confusin'." 
Aerith: "And…" 
 
Aerith: "I'm sorry, forget it!" "I think I'm tired. I'm going to bed now." 
 
Cait-Sith: "What was that, all of a sudden!?" "Is that all? How 'bout the Black Materia?" 
 
Cloud: "You wouldn't understand even if I told you." 
Barret: "Now all we gotta do is take action! We're startin' tomorrow!!" 
 
Red XIII: "Cloud…" 
 
Red XIII: "I'm number 13. Am I going to go mad too?" 
 
Tifa: "I don't know what Hojo did to you, but you've been all right so 
far, right?" 
Red XIII: "But…" 
Tifa: "Be strong." 
 
Red XIII: "But, I…" 
Tifa: "Stop it, Red XIII! Be strong!" 
Cloud: "Tifa?" 
Tifa: "You're not the only one who's worried!" 
Cait-Sith: "I don't know what's goin' on, but we're in a bad situation…" 
Cid: "…zzzz…zzzz…" 
  
   
A Midnight Date Interrupted by Fireworks 
(The  fades in to Cloud's room at the Ghost Hotel. He is standing 
by the window, watching the rain storm outside. There comes a knock at 
the door. Cloud goes to answer it, but before he gets there, Aerith bursts 
in.) 
Aerith: "Hee, hee!" 
Cloud: "What's wrong?" 
 
Aerith: "You want to go on a date?" 
Cloud: "What?" 
Aerith: "A DA-TE! Or haven't you ever gone on one?" 
Don't take me for a fool: Well, not a real one… 
Cloud: Don't take me for a fool 
 
Aerith: "Hey… a littke touchy, aren't we?" 
Cloud: Well, not a real one… 
Aerith: "No, just a mixed-up kid…" 
 
Aerith: "Oh well. Come on, let's go." 
Cloud: "Hey." 
 
"Tonight's Enchantment Night! All the attractions are free." "How 'bout it you two? There's going to be an entertaining show 
in Event Square!" 
Aerith: "Come on, let's go."
 
"Congratulations!!" "You are our 100th couple today!"
"You two will be the leads in tonight's show!!!!" 
Cloud: "Wha?" 
"Oh, now, it's not hard. Just play it however you want to and 
the rest of the cast will cover up for you." "Come this way." 
Cloud: "H, hey!" 
Aerith: "This sounds like fun. Come on Cloud, let's do it." 
(The  switches to the stage at the front of Event Square. The 
backdrop is decked out with paintings of a house, a Debu Chocobo, and 
"GOLD SAUCER" scrawled in clumsy white letters.) 
Narration: "Long, long ago…" "An evil shadow appeared over the peaceful kingdom of Galdia…" "Princess Rosa was just kidnapped by the Evil Dragon King, 
Valvados. What will become of her?" "Just then, the legendary hero, Alfred, appears!!" 

Knight: "Oh… You must be the legendary hero… Alfred!" 
 
Knight: "Hey, it's your line." 
 
Knight: "Yeah, you." "Ahem!" 
 
Knight: "Oh… You must be the legendary hero… Alfred!" "I know in my soul. Please… please save Princess Rosa!" 
 
Knight: "Now… Please talk… to the King….!!" 
 
King: "Oh… legendary hero, Alfred. You have come to save my beloved 
Rosa…" "On the peak of a dangerous mountain… dwells the Evil Dragon 
King, Valvados… who's kidnapped Princess Rosa…" "But… you can't beat the Evil Dragon King now! Talk to one who 
can help you……." 
 
Who will you talk to? 
The knight: The wizard 
Cloud: The knight 
 
Knight: "I am… a lowly… knight. How… can I help you?" 
Defeat the Evil Dragon King: Defeat the King 
Cloud: Defeat the Evil Dragon King 
Narration: "Oh what is going to happen next…! Oh… Legendary hero…

(Every one gasps hugely. A giant stuffed dragon swings out on stage, 
holding Aerith, who is playing the part of the Princess.) 
EDK: "Gaaaaaaah!" "I am the Evil Dragon King… Valvados! I have not harmed the 
Princess… I have been expecting… you!" 
Princess: "Please help me… Legendary Hero!" 
 
Princess: "psst…… like that?"

King: "Come on! No more!" 
 
Aerith: "Stop it Cloud! What are you doing!?" 
 
Aerith: "The play's a disaster! Now I'm getting mad!" 
(She runs over and smacks Cloud, who spins around a few times and falls 
over. EDK starts laughing) 
EDK: "Gaaaaaaahh! You dare ignore me!!" 
Aerith: "Why don't you shut up, Blabbermouth!!" 
(She does a flying tackle into EDK, who goes flying offstage. The crowd

Cloud: The Princess' measurements 
 

 
Aerith: "Oh, that was fun. Hey, let's go on the Gondola." 
 
Aerith: "Two, please." 
"Here you are, two tickets." "Enjoy the sights of the Gold Saucer."
(The gondola trundles off. The camera switches to the interior of the 
gondola, Aerith sitting on one side, Cloud on the other. Aerith looks 
out the window constantly.) 
Aerith: "Wow, how nice." 
(Cloud looks out the window. FMV sequence of the gondola passing through 
beautiful searchlights, rides, and various happy things.) 
Aerith: "Oh! Look, Cloud." 
(Cloud looks out the window. FMV sequence as the gondola passes the 
Chocobo track and the Chocobos hurtle past the window.) 
Aerith: "It's so pretty." 
(FMV sequence. The gondola rumbles along its track, through dazzling 
fireworks, lighting up the entire Saucer.) 
Aerith: "It's beautiful, isn't it?"
 
Aerith: "………first off, it bothered me how you looked exactly 
alike." "Two completely different people, but look exactly the same." "The way you walk, gesture…" "I think I must have seen him again, in you…" 
 
Aerith: "But you're different." 
 
Aerith: "Things are different…" 
(FMV sequence. The entire exterior of the Gold Saucer is lit up with 
fabulous, starry fireworks displays. Aerith continues to speak.) 
Aerith: "Cloud…" "I'm searching for you…" 
Cloud: "…………?" 
Aerith: "I want to meet you." 
Cloud: "But I'm right here." 
Aerith: (I know, I know… what I mean
is…): "I want to meet….. you." 
(One final, brightest, most stunnning yellow flower of fire lights up the 
night sky. The gondola returns to Round Square.) 
Aerith: "I had fun tonight. Let's go together again." "You don't like being with me?" 
Yeah: That's not it 
Cloud: Yeah 
 
Aerith: "Oh, don't tease me like that!" 
Cloud: That's not it 
 
Aerith: "I'm glad." "Next time we come, let's take our time and go on more rides." 

Aerith: "Oh, look at the time. We'd better get going." 
 
   
A Spy!? 
(We are at Station Square. Cait-Sith pops out of the Ghost Square portal 
and looks around. Cloud and Aerith return from Round Square. Cait-Sith is 
facing away from them.) 
Aerith: "Hey? What's Cait-Sith doing?" 
 
Cloud: "!!" "Is that the… Keystone?" "Hey! Cait-Sith!" 
(Cait-Sith runs off. They chase him all around the Gold Saucer, visiting 
almost every square, until they reach the Chocobo Square. The chase him 
around the lobby and back outside, where the Shinra helicopter is waiting. 
Cait-Sith tosses the stone up to the helicopter.) 
Cait-Sith: "Here! The Keystone!" 
Tseng: "Well done." 
 
Cloud: "Hey!" 
Cait-Sith: "W, wait a second. I won't run or
hide." "Yes, I was a spy. I was hired by
the Shinra." 
Aerith: "…I trusted you. I can't believe
you!" 
Cait-Sith: "I couldn't help it." "How 'bout if we continue like
nothing ever happened?" 
Cloud: "No way, cat! You gotta lot of guts acting like a friend but 
being a spy!" 
Cait-Sith: "Then what are you goin' to do? Kill me?" "You'd just be wastin' your time if you tried. This body's just 
a toy anyway." "My real body's at Shinra Headquarters in Midgar. I'm controllin' 
this toy cat from there." 
Aerith: "So you're from the Shinra. Who? Who are you! Tell me!" 
Cait-Sith: "Whoa, I can't tell you my name." 
Cloud: "We're not gettin' anywhere." 
Cait-Sith: "See? I told you! Talking won't do any good, so can't we just 
continue our journey?" 
Cloud: "You think I'm jokin'!?" 
Cait-Sith: "…Alright, yes, I am a Shinra employee." "But we're not entirely enemies." "…Something bothers me. I think it's your way of life." "You don't get paid. You don't get praised. Yet, you still risk 
your lives and continue on your journey. Seeing that makes me…" 
 
Cait-Sith: "It just makes me think about my life. I don't think I'd feel too 
good if things ended the way they are now." 
Aerith: "…….And so on, and so on…" 
Cloud: "He'll never tell the truth. Once a spy, always a spy." "We can't go on with someone like that. C'mon, get real!!" 
Cait-Sith: "…just as I thought. Talking won't make a bit of difference." "But I prepared something in case this happened." "Why don't you listen to this?" 
 
"Papa! Tifa!" 
Aerith: "Hey! That's Marlene!" 
"Hey! It's the flower lady! Flower lady…" 
 
Cait-Sith: "…So, you have to do as I say." 
Cloud: "…you're the lowest…" 
Cait-Sith: "I didn't want to do this… using dirty tricks and taking 
hostages…" "But this is how it is… no compromises. So why don't we continue 
on as we did?" 
 
Cait-Sith: "Tomorrow is the Temple of the Ancients, right? I know where it 
is so I'll tell you later." "Of course, we'll get there after the Shinra, but you'll have to 
deal with that." 
 
Cloud: "…Well, we're stuck… We'll have to do what he says." 
Aerith: "I wonder if Marlene is all right… I wonder what happened to 
Mom." 
 
(Cloud wakes up in his room at the Ghost Hotel. He comes downstairs; all 
the party is waiting.)
Cait-Sith: "What took you so long, Cloud?" "Oh yeah, about the Temple of the Ancients. I think if we take 
the Tiny Bronco East towards the sea, we should be able to find it." "Well then, shall we get goin'? Who's gonna go?" 
 
Aerith: "I want to go! I'm going for sure!" 
 

Cait-Sith: "Then see you later." 
  
   
Temple Of The Ancients Tseng's
Meeting 
(Cloud arrives at the Temple of the Ancients. Aerith stands on the rope 
bridge before it, then falls to the ground.)
Aerith: "This is… the Temple of the Ancients…" "I… I know… I feel it… the knowledge of the Ancients.. 
floating…" "You could become one with the Planet, but you're stopping it 
with the strength of will." "For the future? For us?"
 
Cloud: "What are you saying? Do you understand?" 
(Aerith gets up and runs further into the Temple, stopping to stand on the 
stairs leading to the top.) 
Aerith: "You're uneasy… But happy?" 
 
Aerith: "Because I'm here? I'm sorry… I don't understand."
(She runs back to Cloud. Only a sharp-eyed player will see a black-cloaked 
figure exit the door at the top of the Temple and slump to the ground.) 
Aerith: "I want to go inside!" 
(The go to the top on the Temple and find the black-cloaked figure. He 
slowly stands up.) 
"Black…….. Materia….." 
 
Aerith: "Look……" 
 
Tifa: "Number 9. Another man with a tattoo." 
(A white glow bathes the area and a translucent body floats skyward. Cloud 
heads inside the Temple. Inside, they find Tseng slumped against an altar.)
Aerith: "Hey! It's Tseng!" 
 
Cloud: "Tseng? Of the Turks?" 
Tseng: "Uh… I've been had." 
 
Tseng: "It's not the Promised Land… Sephiroth's searching for…" 
Cloud: "Sephiroth? He's inside!?" 
 
Tseng: "Look… for yourself…" 
 
Tseng: "Damn…" "Letting Aerith go was the start… of my… bad luck…" "The President… was wrong…" 
 
Aerith: "You're wrong." "The Promised Land isn't like what you imagined." 
 
Aerith: "And, I'm not going to help." "Either way, there was no way Shinra could have won." 
 
Tseng: "…pretty harsh. Sounds like something… you'd say." 
 
Tseng: "The Keystone… Place it… on… the altar…" 
 
(Tseng goes and slumps in another corner. Cloud goes over to Aerith, then 
faces away from her back.) 
Cloud: "You crying?" 
 
Aerith: "…Tseng's with our enemy, the Turks, but I've known him since 
we were little…" "There's not a lot of people I can say that about. In fact, there 
are probably only a handful of people in the world who really know me."
 
Cloud: "Let's put the Keystone in." 
(The camera switches over Cloud's shoulder as we watch him put the Keystone 
in the altar. It begins to glow a bright blue. A secret elevator opens in 
the floor and Cloud is lowered to a complex maze.) 
Aerith: "Words… feelings… So many of them here." 
Tifa: "What a strange place. Do you think we're welcome here?" 

Aerith: "…Cloud! I know it's going to be tough, but…" "Don't give up! We can do it!" 
(Cloud navigates the maze. There is a little rabbit-like creature, the 
Lagomorph from Final Fantasy 6, that he chases until he eventually catches 
it in a small room.) 
"nyum… nyum…" 
Aerith: "Phew! We finally caught up to you." "I'm sorry. You waited for me." "Those are the spirit bodies of the Ancients." "They've been away from their Planet for a long time to protect 
this Temple." "Over the many years, they've lost the ability to talk." "Actually, they didn't need words from the beginning because 
there was only one objective for those left in the Temple." 

Aerith: "Please, talk to me!" 
 
Aerith: "No good. I don't understand the rest. Are you afraid…?" "Is it because Sephiroth is in the Temple? Or something else?" 
(They leave the room and continue through the maze. They encounter the 
Lagomorph again, which they follow into a long hallway. Here, boulders with 
gaps in them roll past, and the player must guide Cloud into the gaps to 
avoid getting squashed. They reach the end of the room, passing a place in 
the center where another walkway joins the hallway. This walkway leads to a 
stone platform with a pool of water, glowing an eerie violet, in the 
center. Aerith stops to catch her breath.) 
Aerith: "Phew-- We did it!" 
Cloud: "Everyone all right? That sure took a lot out of us." 
(The screen flashes briefly. Aerith jumps, runs toward the center of the 
room, then turns back.) 
Aerith: "Oh no… Cloud. Come quick!" 
 
Aerith: "Hurry, this way!"
(They follow Aerith to the pool in the center of the room. It begins to 
emit bright, pure purple light.) 
Aerith: "It's full of the knowledge of the Ancients." "No… not knowledge… consciousness… a living soul…" 
 
Aerith: "It's trying to say something." 
 
Aerith: "I'm sorry, I don't understand." 
 
Aerith: "What?" "What is it?" 
 
Aerith: "…Danger? An evil… consciousness?" "…show? You're going to show me?" 
(The screen goes white, then switches to a room deep within the Temple; 
the walls are painted with intricate murals. Cloud and the others are in 
the foreground, gone transparent, so that we can see Tseng standing in the 
background.) 
Cloud: "…What's going on?" 
 
Aerith: "Wait! Look! It's showing us!"
 
Elena: "Tseng, what's this? Can we find the Promised Land with this?" 
 
Tseng: "…I wonder. Anyway, we have to report to the President." 
 
Elena: "Be careful, Tseng." 
Tseng: "Yeah…" "Hey Elena, how 'bout dinner after this job's over?" 
 
Elena: "Th… Thank you very much." "If I may be excused…" 
(She runs off. Tseng looks down for a moment, then turns and looks at the 
wall.) 
Tseng: "Is this the Promised Land? No, it can't be…" 
(The screen flashes white. A transparent form of Sephiroth walks past, 
seemingly right through Cloud and the others. The screen flashes again. 
Sephiroth floats in, behind Tseng. He kneels, his sword straight up, and 
his body glows white. Tseng turns.) 
Tseng: "Sephiroth!!"
 
Sephiroth: "So you opened the door. Well done." 
 
Tseng: "This place… what is it?" 
Sephiroth: "A lost treasure house of knowledge. The wisdom of the 
Ancients…" 
 
Sephiroth: "I am becoming one with the Planet." 
Tseng: "One with the Planet?" 
(The screen flashes white again. A second Sephiroth forms, flashing white, 
arms raised. He faces the camera. Sephiroth lowers his arms and turns 
away.) 
Sephiroth: "You stupid fools. You have never even thought about it." "All the spirit energy of this Planet. All its wisdom… 
knowledge…" "I will meld with it all. I will become one with it… It will 
become one with me." 
Tseng: "…you can do that?" 
(The second Sephiroth-form lowers his arms and stares straight at the 
translucent Cloud and the others.) 
Sephiroth: "The way……. lies here." 
 
Sephiroth: "Only death awaits you all. But do not fear." 
(Sephiroth draws his sword and rushes Tseng. With the sound of sliding 
metal, Tseng falls to the ground. The screen goes red.) 
Sephiroth: "For it is through death that a new spirit energy is born. Soon, 
you will live again as a part of me." 
(The form of Sephiroth goes rocketing skyward, showing the real Sephiroth 
behind, knelt over Tseng's body, sword drawn, breathing heavily. The  
switches back to the glowing pool.) 
Aerith: "Did you see it?" 
Tifa: "…I saw it." 
Cloud: "…Where is the room with the pictures on the walls?" 
Aerith: "Almost there…" 
 
Cloud: "Sephiroth is here, right?" "No matter what he thinks, it's going to end here." "I'm taking him out!" 
Tifa: "We're here too, you know." 
(They all continue on. They do not notice the form of Sephiroth descend, 
into the glowing pool. Eventually he shoots out, and the pool stops 
glowing.) 
   
Meteor A Wound So Large 
(Cloud continues through the Temple. He reaches a large, round room shaped 
like a clock. The floor is fallen away, leaving a deep, dark pit. The 
spindle in the center of it speaks.) 
"I am the Time Guardian. Ye who seek the knowledge of the 
Ancients. I control the time, select your path." 
(Cloud can spin the clock hands to reach each of twelve doors around the 
room. After getting the treasure in rooms 4, 7, and 8, he sets course for 
room 6. Inside, we see another Lagomorph, who spots the party, freaks, and 
runs into one of many doors. There is one large, central door near the 
top. Aerith runs over to it and bangs on it.) 
Aerith: "Hey! It's locked."
"No good. We have to catch it!" 

Aerith: "You must be tired." 
Yeah: I want to go home 
Cloud: Yeah 
Aerith: "Just hang in there. Someday we'll look back at these hard times 
and laugh."
Cloud: I want to go home 
Aerith: "Yeah. But it'll all be over soon!" 
 
"The Guard that escaped with the key to the door moves on a set 
course." "Memorize the doors he enters and exits to figure out the pattern 
and catch him at an exit." "Oh yeah, oh yeah… you can jump down to the ramp below and to 
the left of the screen." 
(Catching the Lagomorph, they enter the now-unlocked door. Inside, they 
find it is the same room the flashback at the pool took place in.) 
Aerith: "This is the room with the murals…" 
 
Cloud: "Where are you!? Sephiroth!!" 
(The screen flashes white and Sephiroth appears, kneeling at first, then 
straightening and rising into the air. He seems doubled, as if two 
Sephiroths are occupying the same space.)
Sephiroth: "So cold." "I am always by your side." "Come." 
(Sephiroth rockets skyward. Cloud follows, to the right. He finds 
Sephiroth admiring one of the murals. He crosses his arms.) 
Sephiroth: "Splendid." 
 
Sephiroth: "A treasure house of knowledge…" 
Cloud: "I don't understand what you're saying!" 
(Sephiroth starts laughing. The screen flashes white and he disappears. 
Cloud follows again, to the right. He finds Sephiroth, looking at a mural 
which depicts a huge round object hurtling earthward. He is trembling. He 
turns and comes toward Cloud.)
Sephiroth: "Look well." 
Cloud: "At what!?" 
Sephiroth: "At that which adds to the knowledge of…" 
 
Sephiroth: "I am becoming one with the
Planet."

(He lowers them slowly and begins to laugh. The screen goes white as he 
shoots skyward once more. Cloud follows to the right again. He finds 
Sephiroth this time reclining on the floor, leaned against a small altar.)
Sephiroth: "Mother….. it's almost time…." "Soon….. we will become one." 
(Sephiroth slowly stands. Aerith puts her hands on her hips, almost 
comically, as they all assume offensive stances.) 
Aerith: "How do you intend to become one with the Planet?" 
 
Sephiroth: "It's simple." "Once the Planet is hurt, it gathers Spirit Energy to heal the 
injury." 
 
Sephiroth: "The amount of energy gathered depends on the size of the 
injury." 
 
Sephiroth: "…What would happen if there was an injury that threatened the 
very life of the Planet?" "Think how much energy would be gathered!" 
(He pulls his sword from the ground. His whole body begins to flash, 
electrically, as he laughs.) 
Sephiroth: "Ha ha ha. And at the center of that injury, will be me." "All that boundless energy will be mine." 
 
Sephiroth: "By merging with all the energy of the Planet, I will become a 
new life forn, a new existence." "Melding with the Planet… I will cease to exist as I am now." "Only to be reborn as a 'God' to rule over every soul." 
(Sephiroth begins to pulse with energy, faster and faster, until his whole 
body glows an evil white.) 
Aerith: "An injury powerful enough to destroy the Planet?" "Injure… the Planet?" 
Sephiroth: "Behold that mural. The Ultimate Destructive Magic… Meteor." 
Cloud: "That'll never happen!" 
(The screen flashes white as Sephiroth rushes past Cloud, flying through 
the air.) 
"Wake up!!" 
 
Cloud: "Where are you! Sephiroth!" 
 
Aerith: "Wait! Cloud!"  
   
The Black Materia 
(Cloud is standing before the mural of Meteor as the others catch up with 
him. His body flashes with the same electricity that Sephiroth's had 
moments before.) 
Aerith: "Cloud!!" 
 
Tifa: "Hey, Cloud!" 

(Cloud turns his head again to them, then back to the mural. Again he 
turns, then back. He starts laughing.) 
Cloud: "Ha ha ha…. Black Materia." "Ha ha ha…. Call Meteor." 
Aerith: "Cloud!! Get a hold of yourself!" 
(Cloud brings his hands up and clutches his head, and we see that the 
white energy is really another double of Cloud, just like Sephiroth's 
double before. The double disappears, briefly.) 
Cloud: "Cloud…" "I'm… Cloud…" 
 
Cloud: "How should I?" 
(Cloud begins to move his arms and legs randomly, assuming many different 
poses. The double does the same, and it is very apparent that the double 
is moving as another entity, totally separate from Cloud. Eventually he 
stops, and the double seems to disappear into Cloud.) 
Cloud: "…I remember! I remember my way." 
 
Aerith: "…Cloud." 
 
Cloud: "Mm? What's wrong? Is something wrong?" 
 
Aerith: "…It's nothing so don't worry about it." 
 
Aerith: "Right, Cloud! It's nothing." 
 
Aerith: "Sephiroth got away." 
Cloud: "…Don't worry about it. I understood what he was saying." 
 
Cloud: "So this must be Meteor, right?" 
 
Tifa: "Is something going to fall from the sky?" 
 
Aerith: "…this must be magic. Just what Sephiroth was saying." 
 
Aerith: "The Ultimate Destructive Magic, Meteor." "It finds small drifting planets with its magic." 
 
Aerith: "And then collides with them. This Planet might get wiped out 
entirely…" 
(The room goes dark. They all try to keep their footing as it begins to 
shake back and forth.) 
Cloud: "Sephiroth!?" 
 
Sephiroth: "Ha ha ha… It is not me." 
 
(They all recover from the battle. There is a red Summon materia floating 
nearby.) 
Cloud: "Any sign of Sephiroth?" 
Aerith: "He disappeared." 
(They grab the materia, a Bahamut summon, and go to the altar. There is a 
tiny model of the Temple floating above it.)
Cloud: "What is this?" 
 
Aerith: "There's something written on it." 
 
Aerith: "…B.l.a.c.k……. M.a.t.e.r.i.a." 
Cloud: "Black Materia!!" 
 
Aerith: "Hey!" "…Black Materia." "What should we do, Cloud?" 
Shake it: Take it: Leave it 
Cloud: Shake it 
(He goes to the model and gives it a shake. The entire room shakes as 
well. He shrugs.) 
Aerith: "Wait a minute. I'll ask!" 
 
Aerith: "I don't understand……" 
 
Aerith: "What?" "Really!?" 
 
Aerith: "They said that the Temple itself is the Black Materia." 
Cloud: "What do they mean?" 
Aerith: "So, this whole building is the Black Materia?" 
Cloud: "This huge Temple? This is the Black Materia!?" "Then no one could take it." 
Aerith: "Hmm, it's pretty hard. You see this is a model of the Temple." "And inside it is a device, which gets smaller each time you solve 
a puzzle." "As the model becomes smaller, you become smaller too." "Until it's small enough to fit in the palm of your hand." 
Cloud: "So, if we solve the puzzles, the Black Materia will get smaller 
and smaller and we can take it out?" 
Aerith: "Yes, but there's one thing…" "You can only answer puzzles inside the Temple." "So, anyone who solves the puzzle will be crushed by the Temple." 
Cloud: "I see… the Ancients didn't want dangerous magic to be taken out 
of the Temple so easily…" 
Tifa: "Let's just leave it, OK?" 
Cloud: "No. We've got to think of a way to get it out." "Because Sephiroth has lots of different flunkies." "It's nothing to him to throw their lives away to get the Black 
Materia." 
 
Cloud: "This place isn't safe." 
 
Aerith: "So what are we going to do?" 
(Cloud thinks for a moment, until the PHS rings and brings him out of it. 
He answers.) 
"Hi, Cloud. This is Cait-Sith." "I overheard the whole story!" 
Cait-Sith: "Don't forget about me." "Everything you said makes perfect sense!" "You can use my stuffed body for the future of the Planet." 
Cloud: "We can't let Sephiroth get his hands on the Black Materia." "And we can't let the Shinra get theirs on it either." 
Cait-Sith: "But Cloud. There's really nothing else you can do." "Everyone, please trust me." 
I guess we have no choice: No way 
Cloud: I guess we have no choice 

Cait-Sith: "All righty then! Leave it all to me!" "Please hurry, you've got to get out of there!" "I'll be waiting at the exit!" 
  
   
Believe In Me Cait-Sith 
(Cloud heads out of the mural room. At the clock room, the hands are 
instantly set to 6 and 12, allowing him passage to room 12. Inside, he 
checks the exit door.) 
Cloud: "It's warm…" 
 
Cloud: "This isn't good…" 
(Aerith and Tifa get away from the door, just as a Giger-esque alien 
creature bursts out of the wall behind Cloud.) 
Aerith: "Cloud… …behind you." 
 
(After the battle, Cait-Sith burts in through the door, hopping up and 
down) 
Cait-Sith: "Sorry to keep you waiting!! It's
me!!" "I'll handle the rest!"
 
Cait-Sith: "Well, everyone.. Take care of yourselves!" 
 
Aerith: "Cait-Sith…" 
 
Aerith: "Come on, Cloud… Say something." 
 
Cloud: "I'm not good at this." 
 
Cait-Sith: "Mmm, I understand. I feel the same too." 
 
Aerith: "Why don't you read our fortunes?" 
 
Cait-Sith: "Say, that's right… I haven't done it in a while, huh?" "I'm so excited. Right or wrong, I'm still the same 'ol me." "Now, what should I predict?" 
 
Aerith: "Hmm, let's see how compatible Cloud and I are!" 
 
Cait-Sith: "That'll cost ya. Exactly one date!" 
 
Cait-Sith: "Here I go!" 
(Cait-Sith does his fortune-telling dance, then stops hopping and faces 
away.) 
Cait-Sith: "This isn't good. I can't say it." "Poor Tifa." 
 
Aerith: "No! Tell me!" "I promise I won't get mad!" 
 
Cait-Sith: "Is that so? Then I'll tell you." "Looks good. You are perfect for each other!" "Aerith's star and Cloud's star! They show a great future!" "Cloud, I'll be your matchmaker, preacher… I'll do whatever 
you want me to!" "You just call me when it all happens!" 
(Cait-Sith turns to the doorway, still hopping. He stops and sadly slumps 
down.) 
Cait-Sith: "Thank you for believing in me, knowing that I was a spy." "This is the final, final farewell!" 
(He hops off to the altar room. Aerith watches after him. The screen 
fades to black.) 
Aerith: "Be strong Cait-Sith!!"  
   
Cait-Sith In the Shrinking Temple 
 
Cait-Sith: "She told me to 'Be strong.' I feel
so happy." 
 
Cait-Sith: "Owwww……" 
 
Cait-Sith: "What happened?" 
 
Cait-Sith: "I can still move more."
 
Cait-Sith: "This must be it!" "The Ancients sure did a great job making this." 
 
Cait-Sith: "I can protect the Planet too! I'm kinda embarrassed…" 
 
Cait-Sith: "There's plenty of stuffed toys like my body around, but there's 
only one me!" 
 
Cait-Sith: "Don't forget me even if another Cait-Sith comes along." 
 
Cait-Sith: "Good bye, then! I guess I'm off to save the Planet…" 
  
   
Cloud's Sin 
(Cloud and the others stand outside the Temple of the Ancients. Watching. 
The camera pans up to the top of the Temple, as a great black ball of 
energy consumes it, sparking. When it fades, there is nothing left of the 
Temple but a great pit. Cloud goes to the edge of it; there is a small 
black sparkle at the bottom.) 
Cloud: "That's the Black Materia…" 
Tifa: "I'll wait here." 
(Cloud makes his way to the bottom of the pit, followed by Aerith. He goes 
over to the Black Materia.)
Cloud: "As long as we have this, Sephiroth won't be able to use Meteor." 
 
Cloud: "Mmm?" "Can you guys use it?" 
Aerith: "Nope, we can't use it right now. You need great spiritual power 
to use it."
Cloud: "You mean lots of Spiritual energy?" 
Aerith: "That's right." "One person's power alone won't do it." "Somewhere special. Where there's plenty of the Planet's 
energy…" "Oh yeah!" "The Promised Land!" 
Cloud: "The Promised Land?" "No, but…" 
Aerith: "Sephiroth is different. He's not an Ancient." 
Cloud: "He shouldn't be able to find the Promised Land." 
(The screen flashes white. When it fades, we see Sephiroth standing at the 
edge of the pit.) 
Sephiroth: "…Ah, but I have." 
 
Sephiroth: "I'm far superior to the Ancients." "I became a traveler of the Lifestream and gained the knowledge 
and wisdom of the Ancients."
"I also gained the knowledge and wisdom of those after the 
extinction of the Ancients." "And soon, I will create the future." 
Aerith: "I won't let you do it! The future is not only yours!" 
 
Sephiroth: "Ha, ha, ha… I wonder?" 
 
Sephiroth: "Wake up!" 
(The  fades back in, to the bottom of the pit. Cloud clutches his 
head and falls to the ground.) 
Cloud: "Sh… shut up!" 
 
Sephiroth: "There, Cloud… good boy." 
Cloud: "The… Noise…" 
(We see Cloud's double standing straight as Cloud writhes on the ground 
below it. Eventually Cloud stands up and melds with the double.) 
Cloud: "Wa…… aaaa….aaa…." 
(Cloud begins to run, in slow motion, to Sephiroth. It takes almost half a 
minute for him to make the few feet to Sephiroth. Cloud's double just 
stands where Cloud once had. Cloud gives the Black Materia to Sephiroth. 
Sephiroth stands up and begins to laugh.) 
Sephiroth: "…….Well done." 
(The screen goes white as Sephiroth rockets skyward. The camera moves to 
above the pit. Cloud falls and clutches his head, trembling. Aerith goes 
over to him.) 
Aerith: "Cloud, are you all right?" 
Cloud: "…I gave the Black Materia to Sephiroth…?" 
 
Cloud: "Wha… what did I do… tell me, Aerith." 
 
Aerith: "Cloud… be strong, OK?" 
 
Cloud: "Urrrrrrgh… What have I done!?" 
 
Aerith: "Cloud… you haven't done anything." "It's not your fault." 
(Cloud stands up slowly… and punches Aerith. She falls backwards and 
Cloud falls onto her, landing blow after blow.) 
Cloud: "I…! I'm----!" 
 
Tifa: "Cloud--!!" 
Cait-Sith: "Oops! This looks like I came at a bad time!" "I'm Cait-Sith No. 2. Right pleased to meet you all!" 
 
Tifa: "Cloud, what are you doing!?" 
 
Cloud: "Everything is white…" "What did I do? I don't remember anything…" "My memory… since when…? If everything's a dream, don't 
wake me." 
  
   
Aerith's Wood 
(The  fades in… a calm green forest. Aerith pokes her head around 
one tree.) 
Aerith: "Cloud, can you hear me?" 
 
Cloud: "Yeah, I hear you. Sorry for what happened." 
(Aerith comes out from behind the tree; we see her profile as she faces 
to the side.) 
Aerith: "Don't worry about it." 
Cloud: "…I can't help it…" 
 
Aerith: "Oh…" 
(She jumps out from behind another tree on the opposite side of the 
forest, not visibly walking the distance between them.) 
Aerith: "Then, why don't you REALLY worry about it?" 
 
Aerith: "And let me handle Sephiroth." 
(She starts giggling, turns pure white, and disappears. She comes out from 
behind yet another tree.) 
Aerith: "And Cloud, you take care of yourself." 
(She walks back behind the tree, off-handedly leaning back so that we just 
see her head.) 
Aerith: "So you don't have a breakdown, okay?" 
(She goes behind the tree. She drops down from the sky, slowly, 
puppet-like, landing very softly on the ground. Cloud also floats down, 
closer to the camera. He looks around.) 
Cloud: "What is this place?" 
 
Aerith: "This forest leads to the City of the Ancients… and is called 
Sleeping Forest." 
 
Aerith: "It's only a matter of time before Sephiroth uses Meteor." "That's why I'm going to protect it. Only a survivor of the 
Cetra, like me, can do it." 
(She turns and walks a distance into the forest. She turns back to face 
Cloud.) 
Aerith: "The secret is just up here." 
 
Aerith: "At least it should be. …I feel it. It feels like I'm being led 
by something." 
(She cocks her head to one side and waves, cutely, femininely, childishly, 
to Cloud.) 
Aerith: "Then, I'll be going now. I'll come back when it's all over." 
Cloud: "Aerith?" 
(She turns and runs off into the forest, getting smaller and smaller, 
until she disappears into the bright green sunlight. Cloud starts to run 
after her, slowly, but does not go anywhere, just as in a dream. Eventually 
he stops, and Sephiroth speaks, from somewhere.) 
Sephiroth: "Hmm…….. She's thinking of interfering? She will be a 
difficult one, don't you think?" 
(Sephiroth floats down from above, just as Cloud did. He lands, kneeling, 
where Aerith stood moments before.) 
Sephiroth: "We must stop that girl soon." 
  
   
Cloud's Self 
(Cloud awakens in a bed at the inn at Gongaga village. Barret and Tifa are 
standing next to the bed.) 
Barret: "You look like you was havin' a nightmare." "How are you feeling?" 
I seem to be OK: Not good: Don't really know 
Cloud: I seem to be OK 
Barret: "That's good. Man, I didn't know what was gonna happen." 

Tifa: "You know, Cloud, Aerith is gone." 
Barret: "Everyone's out looking for Aerith." 
 
Cloud: "……City of the Ancients. Aerith is headed there." 
Barret: "By herself!? Why did she go by herself!?" "Hey, we're goin' too." 
Cloud: "Only the Ancients, only Aerith can save us from Meteor…" 
Tifa: "Then we must go. What'll we do if something happens to Aerith? 
If Sephiroth finds her, she's in trouble." 
Cloud: "Sephiroth… already knows." 
Barret: "Hey! Why are you still sittin' around?" 
Tifa: "Let's go, Cloud." 
 
Cloud: "No." 
 
Cloud: "I might lose it again." "If Sephiroth comes near me: I might…" 
Barret: "Yeah, godammit! It's 'cuz of you that Sephiroth got the Black 
Materia in the first place. It's your damn fault!" 
 
Cloud: "My fault?" 
Barret: "I know you got problems… hell, we all do. But, you don't even 
understand yourself." "But you gotta understand that there ain't no gettin' offa this 
train we're on, till get to the end of the line." 
Tifa: "Cloud, we came this far… Aren't you even going to settle up 
with Sephiroth?" 
 
Cloud: "No…" 
 
Cloud: "I'm afraid." "If this keeps up, I may go crazy!" "I'm afraid…" 
Barret: "Just a damn jackass, that's what you are…" "Yo, jes' think about it… How many people in this world do ya 
think really understand themselves?" "People get depressed in life because they don't know what's up." "But, they go on living. They don't run away… isn't that how it 
is?" 
 
Tifa: "Cloud… you'll come with us, right? I believe in you." 
 
Cloud: "What… am I supposed to do?" "Pull out of here?" "Pull out? …To where?" 
(The camera pans down. Tifa and Barret are standing by the door to the inn. 
Tifa faces Cloud's room.) 
Tifa: "Cloud…" 
Barret: "Wait a minute, Tifa. Give him a little time." "He has to decide this on his own." 
 
Barret: "You believe in Cloud… right?" 
(He turns and leaves. Tifa looks to Cloud's room again, then follows. The 
camera pans back up to Cloud. He is now sitting on the edge of the bed, his 
head in his hands.) 
Cloud: "……I'm afraid to find out the truth…? But…… why?" 
 
"You awake?" "Those people were so worried that they stayed by your side until 
you woke up." "You sure do have good friends." 
 
Tifa: "Cloud…" 
Barret: "Hey, how are you?" "I just wanna know, which is it gonna be?" "You wanna find out about yourself? Or are you afraid to find out?" "Either way, you stay around here and about all you can do is 
worry about it." "Even if you do go nuts again when you see Sephiroth… If it 
happens, it happens." "I'll go upside your spikey white head and bring you back to 
normal!" 
Tifa: "Cloud, it'll be all right. We're all with you." 
Cloud: "But…" 
Barret: "If it happens, it happens. Don't worry 'bout it." 
 
Cloud: "…You're… right. ……He's right, isn't he?" 
Tifa: "Come on, let's go and find Aerith…?" 
 
   
Bone Village 
 
People in Bone Village 
"Welcome to Bone Village, a town for nature lovers." "What do you want?" 
Where is the City of the Ancients? Do you know where Aerith is? What are you doing? 
Cloud: Where is the City of the Ancients? 
"The City of the Ancients? Oh, you must mean the Forgotten City." 
Cloud: Do you know where Aerith is? 
"Are you talking about that girl? I warned her, but she went 
into the Sleeping Forest anyway." 
Cloud: What are you doing? 
"We're excavating. It's like the land's telling a history of the 
planet." 

"We use the newest system to find buried treasure. We simulate 
earthquakes by using bombs, and then check the sound waves given off by 
the tremors." 
"You can awaken the Sleeping Forest if you have the Lunar Harp." "Once awake, they say the forest will open a road for you." "The girl in pink that just went in also used a Lunar Harp to get 
through." 
I want a Lunar Harp: Not interested 
Cloud: I want a Lunar Harp 
"Ask the guy in the tent below." 
Cloud: Not interested 

"Excavating is a slow process. The treasures we excavate are 
stored in the box next to the tent. Remember that." 
"The forest just beyond here is called the Sleeping Forest. Right 
now the forest is asleep and anyone who wanders in while it's asleep, it 
confuses. You can go in, but you may never come out…" "But just now, a girl in pink and a man in a Black Cape went in. 
You think they'll be all right?" 
 
"The Lunar Harp is somewhere in the ground here. We could 
excavate it for you if you want to." 
Start diggin': I want to buy something: Not right now 
Cloud: Start diggin' 
"It's not just the Lunar Harp you're after. We else are you 
having us dig for?" 
Lunar Harp: Good treasure: Normal treasure 
 
"All right! Then I'll lend you some of my staff. Show us where 
you want to dig!" 
Cloud: I want to buy something 
 
Cloud: Not right now 

 
Please push the Square button to set our staff in position. 
 
Press the Square Button to ignite the bomb for the search. 
 
Each staff member will calculate the tremors and face the buried 
item. In other words, the point where the staff's line of vision meets is 
the Dig Point.
 
Select the Dig Point by moving to the point and pressing the 
Square Button. The staff will dig and search for the item. 
 
"Now, the staff will dig here. The result of the dig will be 
placed in the town treasure box overnight." 
(That night, the staff digs in the chosen spot. If you picked the spot 
correctly, the next morning Cloud finds the Lunar Harp in the treasure 
box.)  
   
The Sleeping Forest City Of the Ancients 
(Lunar Harp in hand, Cloud enters the Sleeping Forest. As soon as he 
enters, we see that it is the same forest as in his dream. He progresses 
further into the forest. Reaching a clearing, the very air glows an 
ethereal green. Cloud looks around.) 
The Sleeping Forest awoke… 
(The green fades. Cloud is treated to some beautiful, idyllic scenery as 
he travels through the Sleeping Forest. On the other side on the forest, 
he arrives at the Forgotten City. The houses, streets and walls are made 
of shells and coral, as if the city was once beneath the ocean. It is 
completely uninhabited. In one of the houses, they find several beds.)
Cid: "Yeah, and it looks pretty comfortable." 
Tifa: "Shall we take a break here?" 
(They all rest for the night. The  shifts to later that night. Cloud 
is awake, and standing away from the others. He looks up.) 
Cloud: "I feel it…" 
 
Cid: "Do you know what TIME it is!?" 
 
Cloud: "Aerith is here. …and so is Sephiroth." 
Cid: "Wa, wa, wait a minute. You serious!?" 
Tifa: "But how can you tell?" 
Cloud: "…It's not an excuse. I feel it in my soul." 
Cid: "Shit, Cloud, we can't be sittin' around on our asses." 
Cloud: "…right. Let's hurry and find Aerith." 
 
   
Aerith's Gift 
(Reaching the intersection near the entrance of the Forgotten City, Cloud 
looks to the north.) 
Cloud: "Aerith's voice…… Coming from there?" 
(He rushes north. Passing through a tunnel, he reaches a secluded, calm, 
mirrorlike pool. Sunlight shines from above, though it is still midnight. 
He continues. He enters a small, spiral-shaped building. Taking a long, 
glass stairway there, he reaches a huge, elegant, crystalline city, 
suspended in space. Continuing on, he finds a small shrine. Aerith is 
kneeling inside it.) 
Cloud: "Aerith?"
(There are five columns forming a path to the shrine, no wider than Cloud. 
Below them is a pool of pure, blue water. Cloud leaps onto the first 
column. The others move as if to follow, but Cloud waves them away. He 
leaps across the other columns and reaches the shrine. He steps onto the 
stairs leading up to the glass platform where Aerith kneels. The screen 
goes red for a moment. Cloud shakes his head and reaches for his sword… 
then shakes his head again and continues. He stands before Aerith. She 
does not move. He faces away and draws his sword. She still does not move. 
He turns to face her. He lifts his sword above his head. She still does 
not move. Cloud brings down his sword.) 
Cid: "Cloud!" 
Tifa: "Stop!" 
 
Cloud: "Ugh… what are you making me do?"
(FMV sequence. Aerith kneels in the small shrine. We see now that she is 
praying. She looks up for the first time and sees Cloud. She smiles. 
Beautifully. The camera pans up. Falling from the bright white light from 
above comes a black figure. It falls faster and faster. We see that it is 
Sephiroth. His sword is drawn. Faster he falls, straight for Aerith.)
 
(The next few moments seem like hours. Cloud's heart pounds in his ears… 
and ours as well. Sephiroth, his sword through Aerith's body, just stares 
at Cloud. His eyes glitter, cat-like, a sly smile on his lips. With a 
great noise of grating metal, he pulls his sword from her body. Aerith 
falls forward, her eyes wide open in shock… but the smile does not 
leave her face. Then her eyes close. As she falls, her hair ribbon comes 
undone and a small materia, glowing a pale green, falls from it. It bounces 
once, emitting a small, pure sound against the glass floor. It bounces 
again, and again, until it falls off the platform into the clear water 
below.)
   
Puppet Descent Into Life 
(Aerith's body falls forward. Cloud catches her before she hits the 
floor, cradling her in his arms. Sephiroth stands, looking skyward, his 
arms spread.) 
Cloud: "…Aerith." 
 
Cloud: "This can't be real!"
Sephiroth: "Do not worry. Soon the girl will become part of the Planet's 
energy." "All that is left is to go North. The 'Promised Land' waits for 
me over the snowy fields." "There I will become a new being by uniting with the planet. As 
will this girl…
Cloud: "…Shut up." 
(He bows his head closer to Aerith, trembling. He abruptly looks up to 
Sephiroth.) 
Cloud: "The cycle of nature and your stupid plan don't mean a thing." 
 
Cloud: "Aerith is gone." "Aerith will no longer talk, no longer laugh, cry…… or get 
angry……" 
 
Cloud: "What about us…… what are WE supposed to do?" 
 
Cloud: "What about my pain?" 
 
Cloud: "My fingers are tingling. My mouth is dry. My eyes are burning!" 
(Sephiroth moves for the first time. He slowly lowers his arms and looks 
at Cloud.) 
Sephiroth: "What are you saying? Are you trying to tell me you have feelings 
too?" 

Cloud: "Of course! Who do you think I am!?" 
 
Sephiroth: "Ha, ha, ha…… Stop acting as if you were sad." "There's no need to act as though you're angry either." 
 
Sephiroth: "Because, Cloud. You are…"
(He rockets, spinning, high up into the air. His body becomes a tiny green 
sphere, which lands at Cloud's feet. The screen glows red. Cloud covers 
his eyes.) 
 
 
Jenova: "Because, you are…… a puppet." 
Cloud: "I'm…… a puppet?"
(The screen fades in. Aerith's body is resting against one wall of the 
shrine. Cid stands before her. He looks skyward as if in prayer, then 
turns and leaves. Tifa kneels next to Aerith. She reaches up and touches 
Aerith's face, her hair, then covers her mouth, squeezes her eyes shut, and 
runs off. Cloud walks over to Aerith. He gently picks her up and carries 
her to the secluded pool. FMV sequence. Cloud slowly lowers Aerith into 
the clear blue water. He releases her and slowly backs away. She floats on 
the surface for one brief second, then her face sinks beneath the water. 
Her hair fans out around her body as she descends into the deep, peaceful 
water.)
   
Who Am I…? 
(The  fades in. Cloud and the others are in one of the spiral-shaped 
shell houses in the Forgotten City. Cloud is facing away.) 
Cloud: "Everyone, listen to me." 
 
Cloud: "I'm Cloud, ex-SOLDIER, born in Nibelheim." "I came to settle up with Sephiroth." 
Tifa: "…What's going on?" 
Cloud: "I came here by my own free will… Or so I thought." "However…" 
 
Cloud: "…To tell the truth, I'm afraid of myself." 
 
Cloud: "…There is a part of me that I don't understand." "That part that made me give the Black Materia to Sephiroth." 
 
Cloud: "If you hadn't stopped me, Aerith might've been…" "…There's something inside of me. A person who is not really 
me." 
 
Cloud: "That's why I should quit this journey." "Before I do something terrible." 
 
Cloud: "But I am going." "He destroyed my hometown five years ago, killed Aerith, and is 
now trying to destroy the Planet. I'll never forgive… Sephiroth." 
 
Cloud: "I… I must go on." 
 
Cloud: "…I have a favor to ask of you." "Will you all come with me?" 
 
Cloud: "…to save me from doing something terrible." 
Cid: "Well, we'll face it when that happens." 
 
Cloud: "I don't know how Aerith tried to save the planet from the 
Meteor." "And I guess now, we'll never know." "But!" 
 
Cloud: "We still have a chance. We must get that Black Materia back 
before Sephiroth uses it." "Let's go." 
 
END OF DISC 1 

   
Winter Wonderland 
 
Tifa: "Sephiroth… I wonder which way he went?" 
(A high-pitched whine emanates from somewhere as Cloud clutches
his head.) 
Cloud: "…ugh." 
(The screen goes a green tint. The camera pans up so show Sephiroth walking 
northward, then he flickers away. The camera pans back. Cloud starts 
shaking his head.)
Cid: "Ey, hey! You alright?" 
Cloud: "Hmmm…" "Sephiroth said to me… Head North……… ……past the Snow 
Fields……" 
(They head north. Traversing a giant conch shell, a deep, dark cave, and a 
snow field, they arrive at the town of Winter.)
People in Winter
"Grandpa, wake up! We have a customer!" 
"…smack… mff… Oh… welcome, glad you came."  
"Next time, I'm gonna make an even bigger one." 
"It's almost finished!" 
"My boy got hurt right about the time we moved here…" "I never should've bought him a snowboard."
"…whimper….. weep….." 
"My husband left 20 years ago an still hasn't come back." "He should at least be at the foot of the Gaea Cliffs. It's marked 
with a check on the map…" 
"The master is an experienced climber, you know." "I've heard that he knows every corner of the Great Glacier!" 
"It's nearly impossible to reach the Northern limits without a
map." "If you're thinkin' 'bout going to the Northern limits, you'd 
better take that map on the wall."
"You heard about the gnarly hill in this town? They tell me it's off 
limits!" 
"What luck! We came all this way… crap!" 
"It's colder than usual today…" "It's 200 gil, you wanna spend the night?" 
"Phew, what is it? Don't get too close, or it'll burn ya."  
   
Gast's Videos 
(Cloud goes to a small shack in the center of town. In it are many 
scientific instruments, blinking, flashing. They look out of place in this 
small town. He takes a look at them.) 
Play the Video? 
No: Yes 
Cloud: No 
Cloud: Yes 
The Original Crisis: What is "Weapon?" Confidential: Don't watch 
Cloud: The Original Crisis 
(The screen fades to black. When it fades in again, we are still in the 
same room, but the scenery is dimmed slightly green. A man dressed in a lab 
coat adjusts some of the instruments the camera pans erratically up and 
down here while a woman in a red dress stands by. The man finishes his 
adjustments and goes over to stand by the woman.) 
"Camera's ready!" "Then, Ifalna, please tell us about the Cetra."
 
"2000 years ago, our ancestors, the Cetra, heard the cries of the 
Planet." "The first ones to discover the Planet's wound were the Cetra at 
the Knowlespole." 
"Tell us Ifalna… Where is the land called 'Knowlespole'?" 
"Knowlespole refers to this area. The Cetra then began a 
Planet-reading." 
"Ifalna, what exactly does Planet-reading entail?" 
"…I can't explain it very well, but it's like having a 
conversation with the Planet…" "It said something fell from the sky making a large wound." "Thousands of Cetra pulled together, trying to heal the Planet…" "But, due to the severity of the wound, it was only able to heal 
itself, over many years." 
"Do the Ancients, rather, the Cetra, have special powers to heal 
the Planet?" 
 
"No, it's not that kind of power. The life force of all living 
things on this Planet becomes the energy." "The Cetra tried desperately to cultivate the land so as not to 
diminish the needed energy…" 
"Hmm, even here so close to the North Cave, the snow never melts." "Is that because the planet's energy is gathered here to heal its 
injury?" 
 
"Yes, the energy that was needed to heal the Planet withered away 
the land… then the Planet…" "The Planet tried to persuade the Cetra to leave the Knowlespole, 
but…" 
 
"Ifalna… Let's take a break." 
 
"I'm all right… When the Cetra… were preparing to part with 
the land they loved…" 
 
"That's when it appeared!" "It looked like… our… our dead mothers… and our dead 
brothers. Showing us spectres of their past." 
"Who is the person that appeared at the North Cave? I haven't 
any idea." 
"That's when the one who injured the Planet… or the 'crisis 
from the sky', as we call him, came." 
 
"He first approached as a friend, deceived them, and 
finally…… gave them the virus." 
 
"The Cetra were attacked by the virus and went mad… 
transforming into monsters." 
 
"Then, just as he had at the Knowlespole." "He approached other Cetra clans…… infecting them with… 
the virus…" 
"You don't look well… Let's call it a day." 
 
Cloud: What is 'Weapon'?" 
(The screen fades in to show the scientist pressing buttons on the console 
again. Ifalna is this time seated in the corner. He walks closer to her.) 
"Ifalna, can you comment on the thing called 'Weapon'?" 
"Yes, Professor." 
 
"The one the Professor mistook for a Cetra… was named Jenova. 
That is the 'crisis from the sky'." "The Planet knew it had to destry the 'crisis from the sky'…" "You see, as long as Jenova exists, the Planet will never be able 
to fully heal itself." 
"Back then, Weapon was a weapon the Planet produced of its own 
will?" 
"Yes, but… There is no record of Weapon ever being used." "A small number of the surviving Cetra defeated Jenova, and 
confined it." "The Planet produced Weapon… But it was no longer necessary to 
use it." 
 
"So, Weapon no longer exists on the Planet?" 
 
"Weapon cannot vanish. …It remains asleep somewhere on the 
Planet." "Even though Jenova is confined, it could come back to life at 
some time…" "The Planet has not fully healed itself yet. It is still watching 
Jenova." 
"Where is Weapon?" 
 
"I don't know…… I can't hear the voice of the Planet well…" "Times… have changed. The Planet… is probably watching this 
situation closely." 
(She rubs her eyes. The professor turns away, shaking his head. He looks 
almost disgusted. The turns back.) 
"…Thank you, Ifalna, that will be all for today." 
(He walks to the console and turns the camera off, leaving Ifalna standing 
there, her face covered in her hands.) 
Cloud: Confidential 
Daughter's Record: 10th Day after birth: Daughter's Record: 20th Day after birth: Don't watch 
Cloud: Daughter's Record: 10th Day after birth 
(The screen fades to black and remains dark as we hear the Professor and 
Ifalna speak.) 
"What are you doing, Profes…… I mean, honey?" 
"Oh, I'm thinking of taping it on video. But, the video's not 
working right…" 
"What are you going to tape? Is there still something I haven't 
mentioned?" 
"No, that's not it. I'm going to record my beautiful daughter." "And when she's sleeping, her face …looks like an angel." 
"First, we have to figure out her name. We can take the video 
later!" 
"I've already decided! If it's a girl, then it'll be Aerith. 
That's that!" 
"You are SO selfish! But Aerith is a good name!" "Hee hee… it's a good name, considering it came out of that 
forgetful head of yours!" 
"Right!? Oh, the video tape……" 
Cloud: Daughter's Record: 20th Day after birth 
(The screen fades in to show the Professor working at the console again. 
Ifalna comes in and stands next to him.) 
"Video again? You just got through taping!" 
"………Please don't say it that way." "It's our lovely daughter, both yours… and mine!" "Don't you want to capture her childhood on videotape?" 
"If you keep doting on her like that, she won't grow up to be 
strong…" "Aerith is different from the other children. I wonder what 
dangers await her…?" 
 
"Never say that! I will protect you and Aerith no matter what!!" 
 
"You and Aerith are my only treasures. I'll never let you go!!" 
"I feel so much better now, darling." "If I hadn't met you, I……" 
(He walks over to her and places his arms around her neck. Just as they 
are about to kiss, there comes an abrupt knock at the door. He turns) 
"Who could that--! I was just about to…" 
 
"Damn!!" "How dare they intrude on our 'private time' together!" 
"I'll send them away." 
 
"Yes, at once!!" "Who the devil?" 
 
"It, it's them!!" 
(She runs behind the Professor. Two Shinra guards rush into the
room, followed by Hojo. He walks right up to the Professor.) 
"Heh, heh, heh…… I've been searching for you, Ifalna… or
should I say, Cetra!" "Long time no see, Professor Gast!" 
 
"Hojo… How did you know?" 
"Believe me, I had to turn over a stone or two to find you." 
 
"Two years I waited…. That's how much I wanted this new 
sample….. Ha, ha, ha." 
 
"…New sample? You don't mean Aerith!?" 
(Gast viciously grabs onto the front of Hojo's lab coat. The two guards 
raise their guns. He freezes. Hojo pushes his arm away.) 
"Hmm, Aerith? What a nice name…… Ha, ha, ha." 
 
"That's it! I'm severing all ties with the Shinra." "Hojo, please leave." 
(Ifalna moves at last. She walks calmly around in front of Gast and 
kneels on the floor before Hojo.) 
"Please, Aerith has nothing to do with it! All you want is me, 
right?" 
 
"Ifalna!" 
 
"I'll need all of you for my experiment." 
 
"You understand, don't you, Professor Gast? We can change the 
future of the Planet!" 
 
"Don't worry, Ifalna. I'll take care of this!" 
"Please don't put up a fight. I don't want any harm to come to my 
precious sample." 
 
"Mmm? What a funny looking camera. Guard! Destroy it!" 
(The guard nearest the camera spins and shoots out the camera.
The screen goes black.) 
"Be careful with her!! Ha, ha, ha……" 
 
"Wh… what are you doing, Professor!?" 
"Ifalna! Take Aerith and run!!" 
 
"Eyaaaaah… Darling……!!" 
 
"Oh, and uh… don't forget the child!" 
"Hmm, a video? The Ancients… Weapon!?" "Heh, heh, heh… a mountain of treasure! Thank you, Professor… 
Ha, ha, ha." 
Cloud: Don't watch 

Cloud: Don't watch 
   
Elena A Snowy Ride Great Glacier 
(Cloud exits Gast's shack in Winter. He goes north, to the steep slope 
past the town, where someone mills aimlessly around.) 
"No, don't! It's a steep downgrade past here!" "It's dangerous, please don't go!" 
I'm still going: Thanks for your kindness 
Cloud: "I'm still going 
"Damn, I was just being nice…" "What the? Who are those people over there? Looks like trouble!"
(The camera pans downward. We see Elena come running into Winter. She 
turns to face her guards.) 
Cloud: Thanks for your kindness 
"No, no. I just did what came natural." 

Elena: "There they are, hurry!" 
 
"Yes ma'am!" 
 
Elena: "Cloud… huff… wheeze." "I won't let you go any further!" 
 
Cloud: "What's down there?" 
Elena: "It's a SE-CR-ET." "It really doesn't matter! But you really got guts doin' my boss 
in like that!" 
Cloud: "You mean Boss… Tseng? That wasn't us. Sephiroth did it." 
Elena: "No! Don't think you can fool me, liar!" 
Cloud: "I'm not lying… it was Sephiroth." 
Elena: "Don't try to act innocent. I'll never forget it!!" 
 
Cloud: "Oh, man…" 
 
Elena: "Looks like talking alone won't cut it. You're going to have to 
feel some pain!" 
 
"Just you… and me!!" 
Elena: "No, I can handle him! There's no way he can avoid my punch." 
"What? Yeah……" 
(Elena throws a punch, leaving the PLAYER, via a series of direction 
presses to avoid it.) 
If you didn't avoid it… 
 
Elena: "Why? Why didn't you try to avoid it…" 
 
Elena: "There's no way they can climb the Great Glacier anyway." "Put them in some house in the village." 
 
If you avoid it… 
(Elena's punch misses and she goes tumbling down the hill, cannonball 
style.) 
"Ele… Elena!?" 
(Her guards give chase. The guy milling around the top of the mountain 
comes out from his hiding place in the trees.) 
"What the…? They sure were weak for Shinras." "Sorry I just took off a while ago… It looked like there was 
going to be trouble." "Anyhow, you'll need a snowboard to get down that hill. Want me 
to teach you to ride one?" 
Yeah, maybe you should: Nope, not interested 
Cloud: Yeah, maybe you should 
 
Cloud: Nope, not interested 
"All right, big-head… But don't blame me if you get hurt." 

 
"I got hurt on my snowboard, and now I can't go out for a 
while…" "Hey, I'll give you my snowboard." "Tell me when you get good at it."
:   
(Cloud receives the Snowboard. He takes it to the slope at the north end 
of the village and rides it to the bottom in an incredibly fun minigame. 
They all land in a heap at the bottom.) 
Cloud: "Ugh…" 
 
Cloud: "I guess we're still in one piece." "Everyone all right?" 
Tifa: "Yeah, somehow." 
Cid: "I can't be doin' this! Damn!" 
Cloud: "So where did we land?" "Looks like we've jumped pretty far…" 
(Your starting point changes depending on which path you took through the 
minigame. Heading right causes you to jump farther.) 
Tifa: "Oh yeah, we got the map, right? Let's look at the map by 
pressing the Square button." 
Cloud: "It sure is cold. We'll freeze if we stay here any longer." 
(Cloud and the others begin to explore the frozen mountain. Everntually, 
they pass out from exhaustion and cold. They come to in a house.) 
"You awake?" 
 
"You collapsed at the Great Glacier. It's a miracle you're all
right." "My name is Holzoff. I've been living here 20 years now." "If you are planning to head North, you'd better listen to my 
story." "Why don't we go to the next room and sit down." 
 
Holzoff: "You ever hear about those who challenged the cliff?" 
Yeah: No 
Cloud: No 
<//>
"There's an old legend that says something fell from the sky here 
a long time ago." "That's what's supposed to have pushed the land up and formed 
this cliff." "30 Years ago, Yamski and I took this cliff on to see what was on 
the other side." "But, we weren't prepared for it. We did expect the temperature to 
be low but…" "On that cliff, there's always a biting cold wind. The cold air 
lowers your body temperature." 
 
"Yamski, was below me. He cut his own rope…" "…and I didn't even notice…" 
 
"Ever since then, I've settled here… continuing to challenge 
the cliff, and provide warning and shelter to my fellow climbers." "If you're going to climb the cliff, there's 2 precautions you'll 
need to take." "First, check your route… It's hard to find because of all the 
snow." "Second, once you get to a ledge, make sure you warm youselves 
up." "Understand?" 
One more time: Yes 
Cloud: One more time 
 
Cloud: Yes 

"You must've used a lot of energy getting up here… Better get 
some rest before you head out." 
  
   
Gaea's Cliff Mako Crater 
(Cloud and the others wake up and leave the shack. Everyone is shivering 
outside in the snow.) 
Barret: "You know, I've been thinkin'…?" 
What is it? Save it for later 
Cloud: What is it? 
Barret: "Seein' a place like this, makes you realize how awesome nature 
is." "But, if anyone ever told me to live here, I'd tell them to… 
you know…" "I tell you one thing though. If I did have to live here I'd 
change things around 'n' make it better." "I guess the total opposite of this would be…… Midgar." "When you think of it that way, Shinra don't seem so bad…" 
 
Barret: "Uuuuurrrrrgh!!" "What the hell am I sayin'!? The Shinra, not bad!?" 
Cloud: Save it for later 

Cloud: "We'll secure the route. You come up later."
(Cloud heads north, to Gaea's Cliff. Traversing a long series of 
uneventful cliffsides and ice caverns, they reach a long tunnel, 
illuminated green. Something groans ahead of them.) 
"Ugh……. Errgaahh!!" 
 

(They exit the tunnel and find themselves on a narrow ledge. Climbing the 
canyon wall, they reach the summit of a huge crater. FMV sequence as they 
see Mako energy spewing pure from the crater. They head down the canyon 
wall.)
Cloud: "An old crater…" "Something fell out of the sky and crashed down here……" "Leaving a scar on the planet." 
Cid: "Damn, this's somethin'. It's gathered up all that energy to try
an' heal itself." 
Cloud: "Sephiroth took that energy and is trying to use Meteor." "Next time the wound won't be so small." 
(They continue down towards the crater. Near the bottom, another 
black-cloaked figure collapses.) 
"…b, back… to… Seph… …i…roth…" 
(They continue, reaching a misty passe. Huge black obelisks rise
from the fog.) 
Tifa: "The time has come to settle things with Sephiroth, huh?" 
 
Tifa: "I, too, have lost many things because of Sephiroth." 
 
Tifa: "Let's go!" 
(They continue on. Arriving at a large rock wall, they see another 
black-cloaked figure. It jumps off the wall to its death before they 
reach it. A ways further, Cloud pauses and looks up at the sky.) 
Cloud: "That's……!!!" 
  
   
The Shinra Airship 
(When the  fades in, we are on the Shinra airship. Rufus and Scarlet 
look out the front bay window. Heidegger stands behind them.)
Rufus: "So, I finally found you." 
Scarlet: "Kyaa haa hah." 
 
Scarlet: "Kyaa haa hah." "haa hah" "haa………….hah" "This is incredible……" 
 
Heidegger: "This is the Promised Land the President has been searching 
for!!" 
 
Rufus: "But, I'll be the one who gets it." 
 
Rufus: "Sorry, old man."
(The camera pans down. We see Hojo laughing to himself in the other corner 
of the room. Rude stands behind him.) 
Hojo: "Heh heh heh……" 
 
Hojo: "That land is no one's." 
 
Hojo: "It's where the Reunion will take place…… They will all 
gather here……" "I wonder if I will see…… Sephiroth?" 
  
   
Reunion The Black Materia 
(Cloud continues on his journey to the North Crater. They reach a long 
land bridge; the wind blows so strong it is visible. Two black-cloaks 
attempt to pass the wind, then get knocked back.) 
Tifa: "We need to cross when the wind is calm, or we'll get swept off!" 
(They cross. On the other side, we see that the land bridge continues on a 
long way, twisting in on itself. Hundreds of black cloaks trudge along it, 
single file. Here and there one jumps off to its death or simply collapses 
in the way. The others walk over them. Continuing along the land bridge, 
they reach a point where they seem to be miles above the earth. Standing 
in the way is Sephiroth.)
"This is the end for all of you." 
(There are two black cloaks kneeling on either side of him. With a swing 
of his sword, they both fall to the ground below. One bounces loudly on a 
stone protrusion before disappearing into the green mist below.) 
Cloud: "Sephiroth!!!" 
 
"This is the end!" 
"You're right. This is the end of this body's usefulness."
(The area goes dark. Sephiroth disappears, leaving only a pulsating jet of 
purple smoke. Cloud's heart pounds in our ears.) 
Cloud: "He disappeared!?" 
Tifa: "He might still be nearby……" 
(The camera pans all around as they look for Sephiroth. They see no sign; 
but now there are two jets of smoke. Suddenly, they hear Sephiroth's voice 
from… somewhere.) 
Our purpose is to deliver the Black Materia to our master. 
 
Cloud: "Our…?" 
Cid: "Hey, hey, ! What's goin' on?" 
 
Those who carry Jenova's cells… 
Cloud: "Master…!?" 
 
Of course… Sephiroth. 
 
Heh, heh, heh… 
(His heart pounds still faster and louder until he falls to his knees. The 
light suddenly returns to the area. Sephiroth is hovering above them, his 
sword drawn. He descends on the party, knocking them to the ground. He 
stands for a moment by the edge of the land bridge, his arms raised to the 
sky. Then Cloud stands, slowly. Sephiroth turns to face him, his sword 
drawn, and the battle begins.) 
 
(Once Jenova-DEATH has been defeated, the entire party meets with Cloud at 
the land-bridge. A small black mass floats where Jenova stood.)
Cloud: "Jenova's cells…" "…hmm. So that's what this is all about." "The Jenova Reunion…" 
Tifa: "Not Sephiroth!? You mean all this time it wasn't Sephiroth we 
were after?" 
 
Cloud: "I'll explain later. Right now, the only thing I'm thinking about 
is beating Sephiroth." 
Tifa: "But Sephiroth is…" 
Cloud: "He's here. the real Sephiroth is just beyond here." "It's both incredibly wicked and cruel…" "But it's releasing a powerfully strong will from deep within 
this planet's wound." 
 
Cloud: "…The Black Materia is back in our hands." "Now all we have to do is defeat Sephiroth and that'll be the 
end of it." 
Tifa: "We'd better not take the Black Materia any further. Why don't 
you give it to someone else to hold on to?" 
 
Red XIII: "You want me to take the Black Materia? ……all right, I 
understand." 
Cloud: "Don't give it to ANYONE. I'm counting on you." 
 
Tifa: "Let's find Sephiroth!!" 
 
Cloud: "We're going in first! You guys stay and keep watch." 
 
   
Cloud's Truth, Or Cloud's Lie? 
(Cloud and the others continue across the land bridge. Braving more winds 
and lightning, they complete another section of the land bridge… when 
the screen goes white.) 
Tifa: "What is this? What happened?" 
Cloud: "Calm down, Tifa." "Sephiroth is near. Anything could
happen." 
 
Tifa: "Nibelheim…"
Cid: "What the hell? Why Nibelheim!?" 
 
Cloud: "This is an illusion Sephiroth made up." "He's trying to confuse us." "It'll be all right. As long as we know it's an illusion, there's 
nothing to be afraid of." "Come on, let's keep going." 
Tifa: "Yeah, you're right…" "Look!!" 
(She points to the town entrance. They all turn to look, then scatter to 
make room. Sephiroth reaches the gates to Nibelheim.) 
Sephiroth: "All right, let's go." 
(Sephiroth appears not to notice the others as he walks further into the 
town. He is followed by two guards and a young man with black, spiky 
hair and a huge sword on his back.) 
Cid: "Cloud's not here……" 
 
Tifa: "Stop… Sephiroth." 
 
Cloud: "This is so stupid…" 
(Sephiroth begins to laugh, covering his mouth in mirth, when the screen 
flashes white and all disappear save the party.) 
Cid: "Hey, Cloud. Let's get back to the real world, huh." 
Tifa: "Cloud… It's just an illusion." "Don't worry about it…" 
 
Cloud: "What's.. next?" 
Tifa: "Stop it already!!" 
Cid: "This is terrible…" 
(The white fades to reveal that we are still in Nibelheim. Every building 
in the town is aflame.) 
Cloud: "…This is what actually happened five years ago." "But…" "It's probably not me that's going to come out of the Shinra 
mansion." "He's going to try and show us another stupid illusion." 
(We see the black-haired young man from before rush out of the Shinra 
mansion.) 
Cloud: "See… didn't I tell you?" 
(He slowly walks into the town, his sword drawn. Zangan is outside the 
inn, while a couple people lie on the ground.) 
Zangan: "Hey! It's you! You're still sane,
right?" 
 
Zangan: "Then come over here and help me!" 
 
Tifa: "I don't want to… watch this. Cloud… don't watch." 
(The young man turns in place slowly, staring at the burning houses. He 
shakes his head sadly.) 
Zangan: "I'll check this house. You check that one over there." 
 
Cloud: "…What's wrong, Tifa? I told you before, right?" "As long as we know that it's just an illusion, there's no need 
to be scared." 
(The screen goes white again, and Cloud and the others are standing amidst 
the flames. Cid goes over to the person laying outside the inn.) 
Cid: "He… hey you! You alright!?" 
 
Cid: "Damn! This was all made up." 
Cloud: "Sephiroth! I know you're listening! I know what you want to say!" 
 
Cloud: "That I wasn't in Nibelheim five years ago." "That's it, isn't it?" 
 
Sephiroth: "I see you finally understand." 
Cloud: "What you are trying to say is that you want to confuse me, 
right?" "But… even making me see those things won't affect me." "I remember it all. The heat of the fire… the pain in my 
body… and in my heart!" 

Sephiroth: "Oh, is that so?" "You are just a puppet… you have no heart… and cannot feel 
any pain…" "How can there be any meaning in the memory of such a being?" "What I have shown you is reality. What you remember, that is 
the illusion." 
 
Sephiroth: "…Do you understand?"
Cloud: "I don't want to understand." 
 
Cloud: "But, I want to ask you one thing. Why… why are you doing 
this?"
(A blink of white. Sephiroth appears in front of Cloud, between Tifa and 
Cid, his arms raised. They run to stand beside Cloud.) 
Sephiroth: "Ha, ha, ha……" "I want to take you back to your real self." "The one who gave me the Black Materia that day…" "Who would have ever thought a failed experiment would prove so
useful?" "Hojo would die if he knew." 
 
Cloud: "Hojo!? What does he have to do with me!?" 
 
Sephiroth: "Five years ago you were…" "…constructed by Hojo, piece by piece, right after Nibelheim 
was burnt." "A puppet made up of vibrant Jenova cells, her knowledge, and the 
power of Mako." "An incomplete Sephiroth-clone. Not even given a number. …That 
is your reality." 
 
Tifa: "Cloud… Don't listen to him…" "Close your ears! Close your eyes!" 
Cloud: "What's wrong, Tifa? I'm not affected by it." "…I wasn't paying attention to him." 
Tifa: "All that talk of Hojo constructing you is a lie." "Don't we have our memories together?" "Being kids together, starlit nights…" 
 
Sephiroth: "Ha, ha, ha… Tifa…" "Why are you so worried and scared by those words?" "Hmm… Shall I show everyone here what's in your heart?" 
 
Sephiroth: "Ha, ha, ha… You look like you're not feeling well." 
 
Cloud: "…Tifa? Is Sephiroth right?" 
 
Tifa: "Cloud…" 
Cloud: "Why are you so scared? Don't worry about me. I'm all right." "No matter how confused I am, I'll never believe a word that 
Sephiroth says." 
 
Cloud: "It's true that sometimes I can't figure out who I am." "There's a lot of things muddled up in my memories." "But, Tifa……." "But you said, 'Long time no see, Cloud' right?" "Those words will always support me." "I am the one you grew up with. I'm Cloud of Nibelheim." "No matter how much I lose faith in myself, that is the truth." 
 
Cloud: "That's why you shouldn't be so scared." "No matter what anyone else says to me, it's your attitude that 
counts…" 
 
Tifa: "No, that's not true, Cloud……" 
 
Cloud: "What's not? Aren't I the same Cloud you grew up with?" 
Tifa: "That's not what I meant… I don't know how to say it…" "Cloud, I need some time… Just give me a little time…" 
(The screen flashes white and Sephiroth is standing on the stairs down to 
the courtyards. All but Tifa turn to face him.) 
Sephiroth: "Cloud… Don't blame Tifa." "The ability to change one's looks, voice, and words, is the 
power of Jenova." "Inside of you, Jenova has merged with Tifa's memories, creating 
you." "Out of Tifa's memory…" "A boy named Cloud might've just been a part of them." 
 
Tifa: "Cloud…" "Please… don't think right now." 
 
Sephiroth: "Ha, ha, ha…… Think, Cloud!" "…Cloud? Ha, ha, ha…… Oh, excuse me. You never had a name." 
 
Cloud: "Shut up… Sephiroth." 
 
Sephiroth: "You still don't understand? Then…" 
(He faces away and starts to laugh. It is the exact laugh as he might 
have made upon his first arrival to Nibelheim. He stops with a dismissive 
gesture and turns to face Cloud.) 
Sephiroth: "Do you remember the picture that we took before we headed for 
Mt. Nibel?" 
 
Sephiroth: "…Tifa, you remember, right?" 
 
Sephiroth: "But there is no way he would know." 
 
Sephiroth: "Now… what happened to that picture?" 
(He pretends to look all around, then practically skips over to the dead 
man lying in front of the inn. The photographer.) 
Sephiroth: "…….is this it?" 
 
Sephiroth: "…Do you want to see it? It turned out pretty good." 
Tifa: "Cloud… don't…" 
 
Cloud: "I… should be in the picture." "Even if I'm not in there, no worry. This is just an illusory 
world Sephiroth made up."
(He looks at the picture. Of course, the young man in the picture has 
black hair, not blond.) 
Cloud: "…Just as I thought." 
 
Cloud: "This picture's a fake. The truth is in my memory." "…Five years ago, I came back to Nibelheim, to inspect the 
reactor. I was sixteen." "The town hadn't changed at all. What did I do…? Oh yeah…" 
 
Cloud: "Yeah, I went to Tifa's room. There, I…" 
 
Cloud: "I played the piano!" "I looked in the drawers!" "I spent the night and went to the reactor in Mt. Nibel. I was 
excited about it." "Because that was my first mission after becoming First Class in 
SOLDIER." 
 
Cloud: "…SOLDIER, First Class?" 
 
Cloud: "…SOLDIER? When did I enter SOLDIER?" 
 
Cloud: "How did I join SOLDIER?" 
 
Cloud: "Why… why can't I remember?" 
 
Cloud: "I'm… I'm…" 
 
Cloud: "That's right…" 
 
Cloud: "…I didn't have to worry about it, because I was…" 
 
Tifa: "……Cloud?" 
Cloud: "Let's go, Tifa. I'm… I'm all right."  
   
Materia Tree 
(The screen fades in to show a crystal cave at the Northern Crater. 
President Rufus enters, standing in the center of the room for a moment, 
enjoying. Scarlet enters.) 
Scarlet: "Wow!! That's amazing!" 
(She runs to the center of the room, to the back wall, and back, looking 
up. Hojo enters just before the camera pans past him to the ceiling of 
the cave. There is a huge, tree-like, awe-inspiring structure there. 
Sunlight diffuses through it, into the cave. One large blue stone is 
nestled in the center of it.) 
Scarlet: "It's all Materia!!" 
Rufus: "The ouside is rich with Mako energy, The inside is a treasure 
trove of Materia. This truly is the Promised Land." 
Hojo: "There is no such thing as the Promised Land. It's a legend… an 
old wives tale… …it's utterly ridiculous." 
(The camera pans back down to show Hojo standing near Rufus. Rufus turns 
to face him.) 
Rufus: "Everything as I imagined it to be. Isn't it splendid?" "It is that kind of dullness that makes you a second-rate 
scientist." 
 
Rufus: "What's happening?" 
Scarlet: "It's coming from within the wall! Something's in there! It's 
moving!" 
 
Hojo: "Weapon…" "Then it really does exist… I didn't believe in it." 
Rufus: "What does this mean?" 
 
Hojo: "…Weapon. Monsters created by the Planet." "It appears when the Planet is in danger, reducing everything to 
nothingness." "That's what was stated in Professor Gast's report." 
Rufus: "I never saw that report… Where is it?" 
 
Hojo: "Here, right here." 
 
Rufus: "You keep a lot of things to yourself." 
  
   
Sephiroth's Ruse 
(The  fades in again and we are at the land bridge. Red XIII, Barret, 
and Cait-Sith are waiting there. The green wind below is rushing past at 
insane speeds.) 
Red XIII: "I wonder how Cloud and the others are…" "It's hard to believe… such a small piece of materia is able to 
destroy the Planet…" 
(The land bridge, the others, everything vanishes in a blink of black. Red 
XIII is left hovering over the winds below. He looks around.) 
Red XIII: "What the!?"
 
Red XIII: "Is everyone all right?" 
 
Red XIII: "What's going on?" "Where am I!? Don't leave me alone!" 
 
"Red XIII, you're here! I'm so glad!!" 
 
Red XIII: "Tifa!!" 
 
Red XIII: "Something is strange… Why was it dark all of a sudden and 
where is everybody?" 
"Everyone's waiting! Cloud's in trouble!" 
 
"Please come. Help us!" 
 
"Over there!" 
 
Red XIII: "R, right!" "I'm not sure I understand… but I'll go if you want me to." 
 
"……hee hee hee… And remember…" 
 
"…the Black Materia!" 
(Sephiroth vanishes, and Barret and Cait-Sith flicker back in, flat on the 
ground. They sit up, slowly, rubbing their heads.)  
   
Identification Number Out Of Our Grasp Once More Weapon Rises 
 
Scarlet: "Mr. President… I've got a bad feeling about this place…" 
 
Rufus: "Hmm… perhaps we should return to the ship now." "We need to prepare for the inspection anyway." 
(The screen flashes white for a moment, and Cloud is standing in the 
center of the cave.) 
Scarlet: "Hey!!! Where did you come from?" 
Cloud: "…don't know…" 
 
Cloud: "This place is going to get rough." "Better leave things to me and get out of here while you still 
can!!" 
 
Rufus: "Leave things to you? Hmph… I don't know what you mean." 
 
Cloud: "This is where the Reunion is happening. Where everything begins 
and ends." 
 
Tifa: "Cloud!" 
(They take no notice. Red XIII comes
running in.) 
Red XIII: "I'm here to help you, Cloud!" 
(Cloud stands still for a long moment, then holds his head. He is almost 
crying. He takes a few steps toward Red XIII, then stops again. Eventually 
he goes all the way over to Red XIII.) 
Cloud: "Thanks… Red XIII. Where's the Black Materia?" 
Tifa: "Cloud!" 
Red XIII: "It's safe. I'm holding onto it." 
 
Cloud: "I'll take it from here. Give me the… Black Materia." 
Tifa: "You can't hear my voice?" 
Red XIII: "Are you all right, Cloud?" 
 
Red XIII: "Then… here you go. I was a little apprehensive holding this 
thing." 
Tifa: "No, don't! Please… stop, Cloud!" 
 
Cloud: "Thanks. ……leave the rest to me." 
(There is a long pause… then the screen blinks white, and for just a 
moment, we see Sephiroth, staring.) 
Come on… the Black Materia 
Please!! Just a little longer!! 
 
Cloud: "Everyone, thanks for everything. And… I'm sorry." 
 
Cloud: "…Sorry." 
 
Cloud: "…Sorry." 
 
Cloud: "Especially you, Tifa. I'm really sorry." "You've been good to me…… I don't know what to say…" 
 
Cloud: "I never lived up to being 'Cloud'." "Tifa… Maybe one day you'll meet the real 'Cloud'." 
(He walks forward and turns to Hojo. Tifa holds her face and sinks to the 
ground, crying.) 
Hojo: "Ha, ha, ha… this is perfect!!!" "It means that my experiment was a complete success!" 
 
Hojo: "What number were you? Huh? Where is your tattoo?" 
 
Cloud: "Professor Hojo… I don't have a number." "You didn't give me one because I was a failed experiment." 
 
Hojo: "What the--? You mean only a failure made it here?" 
 
Cloud: "Professor… please give me a number. Please, Professor…" 
 
Hojo: "Shut up, miserable failure…"
(Cloud slumps down. We hear the sound of an electrical spark, and catch 
another fleeting glimpse of Sephiroth's visage, then Cloud rises into the 
air, spinning, exactly like Sephiroth had at the Forgotten Capital. He 
shoots up to the tree-like structure at the ceiling. The screen goes 
white.) 
Rufus: "Who… was that?" 
Hojo: "…He's a Sephiroth-clone I created after the real Sephiroth 
died five years ago." "Jenova cells amd Mako, with my knowledge and skills, have been 
combined with science and nature to bring him to life." 
 
Hojo: "…I'm not wild about the failure part, but the Jenova Reunion 
Theory has now been proven." 
 
Hojo: "You see, even if Jenova's body is dismembered, it will 
eventually become one again. That's what is meant by Jenova's Reunion." 
 
Hojo: "I have been waiting for the Reunion to start. Five years have 
passed, and now the Clones have begun to return." 
 
Hojo: "I thought the clones would begin to gather at Midgar where 
Jenova is stored." "But my predictions were not entirely correct. Jenova itself 
began to move away from the Shinra Building." 
(The  fades in to show the materia tree. Cloud stands upside down on 
one of the roots, by the huge blue stone in the center.) 
Hojo: "But being a genius that I am, I soon figured it out. You see it 
was all Sephiroth's doing." "Sephiroth is not just content to diffuse his will into the 
Lifestream; he wants to maniplate the Clones himself." 
(The room seems to darken and Cloud sits down on the root, defying 
gravity. He crosses his arms on his knees.) 
"Yes, that was how it got started." 
 
Hojo: "I wondered where the clones were going, but I was never able to 
figure it out." 
 
"I couldn't figure it out, either." 
 
Hojo: "The one thing that I did know was that Sephiroth was at their 
final destinations." 
 
"I wasn't pursuing Sephiroth." 
 
"I was being summoned by Sephiroth." "All the anger and hatred I bore him made it impossible for me to 
ever forget him. That and what he gave me." 
 
"Sephiroth? Sephiroth? I'm here. And I have brought you the Black 
Materia." "Show yourself to me. Where are you?" 
 
"Sephiroth… So we finally meet again."
 to the center of the tree. FMV sequence. The blue 
stone slips, then falls down, sending small stones to the floor below. We 
see that the stone is a cocoon for Sephiroth. His body sleeps inside it, 
prefectly preserved, sleeping, waiting. The  switches back to the 
floor. Rufus and Scarlet have left. The entire room quakes violently.) 
Hojo: "Did you see it!! It's Sephiroth! So he IS here!" 
 
Hojo: "This is perfect! Both Jenova's Reunion and Sephiroth's will!" "They won't be diffused into the Lifestream," "but gathered here! Mwa, haa, ha,….." 
 
Tifa: "What are you so happy about, Professor? You know what this means, 
don't you?" "Cloud has the Black Materia!" "Sephiroth is going to summon Meteor! Every single person is 
going to die!" 
 
Rufus: "Whatever I say now is too little… too late… We must 
evacuate." 
 
Rufus: "I want you all to come with me. There is still much more I want 
to hear." 
(The camera pans up to show Cloud preparing to hand the Black Materia to 
Sephiroth.) 
Red XIII: "Cloud, NO! Stop! Please!" 
(Cloud holds his head in his hands for a moment. Then he begins to spin in 
midair, rising and falling, like a marionette.) 
Tifa: "Cloud-----!!"
(FMV sequence. The blue stone becomes a liquid, and Cloud pushes his hand, 
and the Black Materia into it. The Black Materia fuses with Sephiroth's 
body. His face maintains its expression of calmness as his whole body 
begins to spark with energy. The materia tree and the stone crumble to the 
ground as the others rush out of the cave and onto the airship. As the 
airship flies away, a beam of energy shoots from the northern craters, 
nearly knocking the party off the airship. As the beam grows and grows, we 
see what is inside it. The Weapon. It rises from the crater, dwarfing 
the airship as it releases a beam of pure energy from its maw. The Weapon 
creates a barrier of energy around it as it rockets off across the 
continent. The airship flies off.)  
   
Origins Sector 7 Train Station 
 
Tifa: "Cloud…" "Cloud…" 
(The tiny Cloud stands up and runs off into the blackness. Tifa runs onto 
the screen and chases him into the nothing.) 
Tifa: "……I didn't know what else to do. I was always like that…" 
(The  fades in to show the Sector 7 train station. It is raining. 
Cloud, his sword across his lap, slumps by the stairway to the train 
platform. The train conductor is looking down at him as Tifa enters.) 
"What's the matter?" 

Cloud: "ohhh…" 
"……poor kid." 
Cloud: "Ooouugh……" 
 
Tifa: "Are you all right?"
Cloud: "oo… uh… agh" 
(She kneels by him and tries to lift him up. The screen flashes 
electrically white again.) 
Cloud: "Uh… uh… Tifa…?" 
 
Cloud: "Tifa…?" 
 
Cloud: "Tifa!" 
Tifa: "……………….?" 
 
Tifa: "Oh, Cloud!" 
 
Cloud: "That's right. I'm Cloud." 
Tifa: "Is it really you, Cloud? I never thought I'd find you here!" 
Cloud: "Yeah, it's been a while." 
Tifa: "What happened to you? You don't look well." 
Cloud: "……Yeah? It's nothing. I'm okay." 
(Tifa walks a short distance away. The screen flashes again. Cloud 
clutches his head, shaking, for a brief moment. He stops before Tifa 
turns around.) 
Tifa: "How long has it been?" 
(The screen flashes again. Three times. He grabs his head, in pain, but 
Tifa does not seem to notice.)
Cloud: "Five years." 
Tifa: "…………" 
Cloud: "What is it?" 
Tifa: "…It's really been a long time." 
 
Tifa: "Actually, it's been seven years." "You got your wish and joined SOLDIER, quit after the Sephiroth 
incident, and now you're a mercenary…" "You told me a lot about what happened after you left 
Nibelheim…" "But…" "…Something's wrong. I felt there was something strange about 
the things you talked about." "All the things you didn't know that you should. And other things 
you shouldn't know that you did…" "I wanted to make sure…" "But then I heard… you were going far away…" 
 
Tifa: "And I didn't want that…" "I didn't know what to do. So, I thought I needed more time." "And that's why I told you about the AVALANCHE job. I wanted to 
be with you, watch you." 
(The screen goes white. We hear the cry of the planet we heard at 
Bugenhagen's observatory.)  
   
Dark Sun 
(The white screen fades in just enough to make out Tifa's form, lying on 
the floor, or a bed.) 
Tifa: "Ding…" 
Barret: "Huh? 
Tifa: "The glare…" 
Barret: "You'll be better soon. You've been asleep a long time." 
Tifa: "I'm hungry…" 
Barret: "Hey, why don't you ask?" "About him." 
(The  fades the rest of the way in. Tifa has been lying on something 
resembling an operating table, in an auxiliary room in Junon. Slowly, she 
sits up. She looks at Barret, standing by the far wall.) 
Tifa: "…Because I'm scared." 
Barret: "Don't worry. I don't know what happened to Cloud either." 
 
Barret: "Guess I shouldn't tell you not to worry…" "None of them know if he's all right or not." 
Tifa: "He's still… alive, right?" 
 
Tifa: "How long… was I asleep?" 
Barret: "Lessee now…… Must've been about 7 days."
Tifa: "What about Sephiroth?" 
 
Barret: "You ain't over it yet. Remember that huge light, in the 
Northern Cave?" 

Barret: "Since then, the crater's been surrounded by a huge barrier of 
light." "Everyone knows Sephiroth sleeps in that big hole, protected by 
the barrier."
"We can't do a damn thing about it. We just gotta wait till he 
wakes up." 
 
Barret: "And on topa that, some huge monster called Weapon's been on a
rampage."

 
Tifa: "…Weapon?" 
 
Barret: "Remember that huge monster that was made with Sephiroth, at the 
bottom of the crater?" "Well it's up here now. They say it's some legendary monster from 
the past." 
Tifa: "Weapon… is protecting Sephiroth?" 
 
Barret: "Dunno. But he's up here goin' around tearin' shit up." "Right now Rufus' fightin' it. I hate to say it, but he's got 
guts." 
 
Barret: "We shoulda been the ones to destroy it, but we ain't got no 
time…" 
Tifa: "Time…" 
 
Tifa: "…Hey! How about Meteor?"
(Barret doesn't say anything. Instead, he walks further away and presses a 
button. The window shades open up. FMV sequence. The camera sweeps past 
the room to the window, and past Barret's profile we see Meteor hanging 
in the sky like a dark sun.) 
Tifa: "Do we have to give up?" 
Barret: "…Dunno." 
(The door to the room slides open with a hiss and President Rufus walks 
in.) 
Rufus: "I thought Cloud would show up to save you all…" "Professor Hojo wanted to check up on Cloud, too." 
Tifa: "What are you going to do to Cloud?" 
Rufus: "Sephiroth's alter ego…" 
 
Rufus: "Meteor has been summoned… Essentially, it's all but over now." "So, there's no need for you now." "No, maybe there is an important task for you…" 
 
Heidegger: "President! Preparations for the public execution are complete." 
 
Barret: "Execution!?" "What're ya gonna get by executin' us?" 
Rufus: "You are to be executed for causing this situation." "People are ignorant. They'll feel better as long as someone is 
punished." 
 
Barret: "I take back what little praise I had for this damn jackass!" 
 
Rufus: "Well, enjoy your last moments
together." 
 
Heidegger: "I'll tie your arms now." 
(He does so. A guard leads Barret and Tifa through the Military Base Junon 
to the bottom floor, where the gas chamber awaits.)
   
Public Execution Weapon Attacks Camaderie Cheating Death 
Highwind 
(Barret and Tifa are led, bound, to the bottom floor of Junon Military 
Base. To the gas chamber. They arrive at a large auditorium, with rows 
upon rows of seats available to watch the event. A rather large, round 
fellow sits in the front row. Scarlet speaks at a podium.) 
Scarlet: "Is everyone here? These are the ones who brought this madness 
into the world!" 

Barret: "The hell are these people?" 
Scarlet: "We will be broadcasting your miserable deaths live on national
television." 
 
"Scarlet, why a public execution in this day and age?" 
 
Scarlet: "With the chaos resulting from the Meteor reports, we desperately 
need to rally public support… it's better that we punish somebody, 
anybody." 
Tifa: "You make me sick…" 
 
Scarlet: "Ha, ha, ha, ha!" "They'll never admit it, but everyone loves this stuff!" 
 
Scarlet: "We'll start with this girl." 
 
Barret: "If you've gotta do it… do me first!" 
Scarlet: "Camera, this way! Make sure you get this, the audience just eats 
up tearful goodbyes!"
(A cameraman films Barret. The  fades in to the interior of the gas 
chamber. Tifa enters, followed by Scarlet. She kicks her toward the chair.) 
Tifa: "What are you doing!?" 
 
Scarlet: "This is my special gas chamber.
Take your time, and enjoy a slow, painful
death." 
(A guard moves forward and removes Tifa's cuffs. Scarlet punches her into 
the chair. The guard fastens her in.) 
Scarlet: "Stuck up ^%$#&!!" 
(She slaps Tifa again and leaves. The guard follows, but drops something 
on the way out. The  fades back to the auditorium.) 
Scarlet: "Well now, the show's about to begin. Ha, ha, ha!" 
 
"Emergency! Emergency!" "Weapon's approaching! Attention all military personnel: take 
your positions!" 
"Oh no! It's Weapon!" 
 
"Run!" 
(Everyone else follows except Barret, Scarlet, the round fellow, two 
guards, and, of course, Tifa.) 
Scarlet: "Hey, hey, all of you!" "Damn! Why now?" 
 
"How does it feel now, Scarlet?" 
Scarlet: "Hmm, so you didn't run? I'm impressed. How do I feel? Right 
now……" 
 
Scarlet: "Nngaaaaaahhhh!" 
Barret: "Huh!? Sleeping gas?" 
(The fellow spins around, shedding his coat. It's Cait-Sith. The two 
guards ready their guns.) 
"Weirdo!!" 
 
Cait-Sith: "I'm here to help!" 
Barret: "Why you……? Ain't you part of Shinra?" 
 
Cait-Sith: "Let's just say I'm against capital punishment. Besides… I 
hate this broad. Come on, we gotta help Tifa." "I'll keep watch at the entrance." 
(Cait-Sith stands by the door while Barret runs to the gas chamber 
entrance. He grabs and pulls. It doesn't budge.) 
Barret: "It won't open!"
(The  fades in to President Rufus' office. Rufus is standing by his 
desk, gazing out at the sea through a huge picture window. Heidegger 
comes rushing in.) 
Heidegger: "It's Weapon." 
Rufus: "There's been so many attacks lately. Can we handle it?" 
Heidegger: "I believe so. Your orders?" 
Rufus: "No need to ask." 
 
Heidegger: "We'll give it a shot from our big cannon." 
 
Heidegger: "Open cannon doors!! Activate cannon. Target: Weapon!!" 
(He turns back to the President as the sailors run off. FMV sequence. Huge 
steel plates protect the buildings in the residential area. A huge port 
opens in the street by the sea; a smaller cannon extends from it. The huge 
main cannon rotates into place, aiming at the sea. Back in the office, one 
sailor comes back in and salutes.) 
"Preparations complete!" 
 
"The cannon…" 
 
"Fire----!!!" 
(FMV sequence. The cannon releases a huge burst of energy out at the sea. 
It recedes toward the horizon; a pregnant pause as we wait for it to hit 
its mark. It does. A large explosion rises from the water, sending a tidal 
wave in all directions. The FMV ends. The  switches to the 
President's office. Heidegger slowly lowers his arm. The  changes to 
several points around the Base; soldiers stand expectantly, waiting, 
watching the sea. The  switches back to the office, panning up to 
show Rufus and Heidegger once more. Both stare out at the sea. Rufus turns 
his head.) 
Rufus: "Did we get 'em?" 
Heidegger: "Seems so…" 
(Another red alarm goes off through the base. Heidegger looks around, 
disoriented.) 
"Weapon approaching!" "Speed, 50 knots!" "It's heading right toward us!" 
 
Heidegger: "It can't be! We hit it dead on!" 
 
Rufus: "How about the cannon?" 
Heidegger: "It'll take time to reload." 
Rufus: "Then use regular firepower in the mean time!" 
 
Heidegger: "Yes sir! Open all artillery doors! Target: Weapon! Don't let it 
land!" 
(FMV sequence. Weapon closes in through the water, fishlike, rising out of 
the water. Soldiers placed all around the Base fire their weapons. The 
smaller, secondary cannons fire energy bursts at the Weapon. None have any 
effect. It comes closer. Soldiers switch to their bazookas, sending 
trails of smoke towards the Weapon, ending in explosions. It continues, 
ripping a huge wake in its path. Inside the President's office, Rufus 
shakes his head in disbelief and steps back from the window.) 
"Speed: 70 knots!" "Weapon closing in!" "Not good! It's attacking!" 
(As Weapon almost reaches the base, the soldiers flee inside. One faints 
on the ground just before Weapon crashes into the base, creating an 
earthquake throughout. It slowly sinks back into the water. The  
switches back to the gas chamber. The gas jets turn on around Tifa.)
Tifa: "Gas!!" 
 
Tifa: "Barret, help!!" 
 
Barret: "Hold your breath! Hold on as long as you can!" 
 
Tifa: "Come on! I can't hold on forever!" 
(The  switches back to the auditorium. Barret jerks on the door a few 
more times before giving up. He pounds the door with his fist in anger.) 
Barret: "Shi-!" 
 
Barret: "The Gas Room's probably locked from a different room!" 
Cait-Sith: "Hmm, we gotta go with a different plan. Let's get out of this 
room first." 
 
Barret: "Tifa! I'll help you, I promise!"
(Barret and Cait-Sith run out of the auditorium. The door slams behind 
them. Barret yanks on it.) 
Barret: "No! They locked this too!" 
 
Scarlet: "Fools. Now, you can't save the girl." 
 
Scarlet: "Ha, ha, ha, ha!!" 
 
Barret: "Goddammit……!!" 
 
Cait-Sith: "OK, OK time for Plan B. Let's run to the airport!" 
Barret: "Why the airport? An' leave Tifa there?" 
Cait-Sith: "Trust me, trust me. We gotta take a chance."
(They run off. Outside the base, they find a cameraman filming the action. 
As they try to pass, there is a huge flash of light. FMV sequence as 
Weapon rises out of the water, majestically deadly.)
Barret: "Damn, man!" 
 
Barret: "Yo! You sure this is the right way? It's a dead end!" 
Cait-Sith: "Uh oh? Did I make a wrong turn?" 
 
Barret: "You damn cat……! What the hell're we gonna do now? They all 
be comin' soon!" 
 
Barret: "Yo, better watch my back till the end… partner!" 
(He raises his gun. The  switches back to the gas chamber. Tifa is 
still alive. She uses her feet to grab the item the guard dropped before 
a key. She uses her teeth to unlock one hand, then the other. She rises 
from the chair.) 
Tifa: "Which button stops the gas…?" 
(Covering her face, she presses the button by the chair, shutting off the 
gas. She tries the door with all her strength, but it doesn't budge.) 
Tifa: "Open it---……" 
(There is a sudden explosion. FMV sequence. Outside, the Weapon pulls 
itself up to its full height. It shakes violently as its maw begins to 
glow, brighter and brighter, then releases a beam of pure energy at the 
Base. It lands on one tower, ripping a giant hole in the side of. The hole 
opens into the gas chamber. Weapon begins to gather energy for another 
salvo. A split second before it releases its beam, the Junon cannon the 
Sister Ray fires square in its face. As the smoke clears, we see the 
Weapon, sans head, sink into the ocean. The  switches back to the 
gas chamber. There is a huge hole opening onto the side of the tower. 
Scarlet yells through the door.) 
Scarlet: "What d'you do? Hey! Open it!" 
Tifa: "First you lock me in this weird place, and now you're telling 
me to come out? Make up your mind!" 
(She climbs through the hole out onto the side of the tower, then nimbly 
begins to descend the side of it. Scarlet and her guards give chase, 
without much success. The guards lose their grip and tumble past Tifa to 
the ground. She jumps the last twenty feet or so and lands in a heap. 
Picking herself up, she runs blindly away. The only route available is 
directly onto the top of the Sister Ray. She arrives at the end. There is 
no way out except down.)
Scarlet: "Our little game of hide and seek
ends here." 
 
Scarlet: "The execution may have been unsuccessful, but your death by 
falling from here and crashing into the water below might be pretty 
exciting." 
 
Scarlet: "Stuck up to the end!" 
Tifa: "Quit slapping me! You old wench!" 
(Tifa, controlled by the PLAYER, slaps back. Tifa and Scarlet exchange 
slaps and insults until Scarlet falls on her rear end.) 
Scarlet: "God! I can't stand it!" 
 
Scarlet: "Take her away." 
 
Scarlet: "Now it's time to pay up. I'll really drop you if you don't 
settle down!" 
 
Scarlet: "Ha, ha, ha, ha!" 
"Run…" 
 
"Run to the end of the Cannon!!" 
(Tifa does. FMV sequence. When she reaches the end of the cannon, she sees 
the Shinra airship rising before her. Barret stands on deck, waving to 
her. He grabs a rope and tosses it over the side. Tifa makes a running 
leap for it, but misses. She falls toward the ocean, but catches the rope 
at the very end as it swings toward her. The airship flies off, into the 
sunset.)  
   
Highwind Takes To the Skies 
 
Barret: "You okay?" 
 
Tifa: "My cheeks hurt a bit." "Forget about that, what's this all about?" 
 
Cait-Sith: "Well, I'll catch the details later." "In any case, the Airship, Highwind, is now yours." 
(Barret and Cait-Sith go below deck. Tifa follows. When she catches up, 
she finds them standing on a wire walkway.) 
Barret: "Dammit! Why didn't you tell me you could fly an airship?" 
 
Barret: "I thought…… Tifa was gone for good." 
Cait-Sith: "Sorry, but I had to do something to trick the enemy." "Come on! Everyone is waiting!" 
 
Tifa: "Everyone? Everyone's here?" 
(She follows them into the main navigation room. Cid comes jogging up to 
her) 
Cid: "Welcome to my airship the Highwind!" 
 
Cid: "What's wrong!? You should be more excited than that!" 
 
Red XIII: "Cid……" 
 
Cid: "Yeah……" 
 
Tifa: "Not enough crew."
People on the Highwind 
Cid: "Well, it takes all kinds." 
Cait-Sith: "Tifa, I'll give you information Shinra." "Ask me if there's anything you don't understand." 
"Whenever anyone talks to me, I get all nervous and mess things 
up!" 
 
Cid: "Hey you! What the hell are you doin'!?" 
"All we have to do is just pilot. They don't have to talk to us." 
Red XIII: "Do you think we aren't strong enough without Cloud?" "Do you think we can't save the Planet alone?" 
 
Tifa: "Meteor is coming, and Weapon is on the rampage……" "At a time like this, I don't know what I'm supposed to do……" 
 
Tifa: "No idea at all……" 
 
Barret: "Get a hold of yourself Tifa! C'mon, let's think about this!" "No way we can get offa this train we're on!" 
Tifa: "……If only Cloud was here, everything would be fine." "Cloud would……" "Stand that cocky little way he did, and tell us what to do." 
 
Tifa: "He'd say, 'Everything's under control, Tifa.'" 
 
Barret: "Tifa! When'd you become such a wimp!" 
Tifa: "I'm sorry Barret." "I'm kind of shocked myself. I'm so depressed." 
 
Red XIII: "And Tifa…… the reason why we all thought it was Cloud was 
because……" 
 
Tifa: "……I know." "That's why I want to make sure. That's why I have to see him 
again."  

Cid: "I want you to know that I didn't dislike him." "Gotta admit he was a strange dude." "Just when you thought he was cool, he'd go and do some damn 
fool thing." "And when you thought he was smart, he'd show how stupid he was." 
 
Cid: "Everything about him from his movements to his speech were 
kinda odd." "Knowin' what I do now, I can see why he was that way." "Well, as long as you stay alive, you just might see him again 
someday, so cheer up, sis." 
 
Tifa: "……I'll be able to see him someday." 
Cid: "If we can find out where he is, the Highwind'll get us there in 
no time." 
 
Red XIII: "……Maybe" "Cloud is still stuck deep in the North Crater, where the ground 
cracked and swallowed him up……" "Buried in the depths of the underground……" 
Tifa: "Deep within the earth… are you talking about the Lifestream?" 
Red XIII: "The Lifestream sometimes gushes out to the surface from cracks 
in the ocean floor." "I heard that such a place exists." 
 
Red XIII: "Maybe, just maybe Cloud's……"  

Pilot in training : "Waaaah! Captain Cid!" 
Cid: "Tifa, sorry, but I've gotta show this moron how to land the 
ship." "Don't worry, it'll be done in a minute." "Oh, and Tifa……" "No matter what your goal is, you've got to be prepared." "Go to your room and get ready for our operation."  

Barret: "What? Does Cloud always gotta be around?……" "We did fine without him in the beginning……" "Right? An' what happened to tough girl I used to know? Where'd 
she go to?"  

Cid: "I put a lot of things for the operation in your room, so go get 
them in order." 
"My hands are full, so I'll excuse myself here!" 
Fly Airship: Chew the fat 
Tifa: Fly Airship 
 
"So things have come to this… When you want to take off, just 
tell the pilot on the bridge." 
Tifa: Chew the fat 
"……Well……… Um, what should I talk about?" "Wanna hear why we rebelled?" 
Listen: Don't care 
Tifa: Listen 
"Working on the Highwind, we spent every day slaving under 
Heidegger." "Whenever he got yelled at by the President, he'd immediately 
take it out on the crew." "We put up with this all the time. Even when he beat us." "I mean, I finally made it on the crew of the famous Highwind, 
and there's no way I was going to quit over him." "Let's see, it must've been a week ago… it was my shift and we 
were heading towards the North Cave." "Everyone, including the President and Scarlet, got on." "And with them, I saw Cid, a legendary pilot!" "And he was looking around the inside of the ship looking really, 
y'know, nostalgic……" "He even talked to us." "I couldn't believe it! I was so impressed! He was every bit as 
warmhearted as we'd always heard." "Cid said that if he had the Highwind, things would be a lot 
easier." "And now here we are off to save the Planet. It's true. He really 
overwhelmed me." "And that's why we decided to help." "After the North Cave, we went to Junon, and I started screaming 
'Fire! Fire!'" "In the middle of all the commotion, we stole this ship from the 
Shinra." "That's how it happened. ……Just a minor mutiny against our 
leaders." "But Barret and you were captured by Heidegger……" "We waited seven days for a chance to rescue you guys, before we 
finally could." "So thanks to our successful mission, we were able to see you 
again." "I hope I didn't bore you too much with that long story." 

"I'm bored…… I'd like to ride a Chocobo." 
How do I? Later 
Tifa: How do I? 
"Listen…… you gotta ride in on a Chocobo once you've raised 
yourself" "Then, if you bring your Chocobo to this stable, I'll take care 
of it for you." "I'll take care of it for you." "What? How do you raise a Chocobo? Can't say I know much about 
that." "If you want to know about raising Chocobo, there's a Chocobo 
ranch near Midgar. You should ask them."
Tifa: Later 
"Whew……" 

 
"Tifa, thank you for a job well done!" 
(You can choose your party here. After choosing your party, Tifa goes to 
the pilot and takes off.)  
   
Mideel Mind of a Friend 
(Tifa pilots the Highwind to the southernmost continent, to the town of 
Mideel.) 
People in Mideel 
"Ahoy! Hey ain't you a beaut. This here's Mideel. It's a quiet 
little Hot Springs town." "Just the perfect place for old folks like us to live out our 
lives." "I hear that things ain't so peaceful on the outside. But here 
it's still nice and quiet." 

"But anyhow, that overgrown moon is going to fall down on us 
isn't it?" "This's no joke! We've got to start stocking up on supplies 
before they're all gone!" "Outta the way! Hey, move it, move it!" 
"Welcome! We always welcome cash! What can I help you with 
today?" : "Thank you! Come again!" 
"Huh? Never seen you here before. You from outta town? How're 
things on the outside?" "Between the earthquakes and Meteor…… it just might be the 
end of the world like everyone's been saying'…" "Oh, how depressing! What a miserable world this is……"
"You again! You aren't here hoarding up goods too are you?" "Don't reach in front of me! Everything in this store is mine!" "I've got money to burn! I've been saving like mad just for a 
time like this!" "C'mon, outta the way! Move, will you, move!" 
"Welcome, this store! Very rest and recreation shop. Where you 
go?" "Oh no, other customer take up everything. Not leave anything 
for you…"
"…gah, hah, hah… dassa joke! So where you go?" : "Thank very much! You come 'gain."
"Gather 'round, gather 'round, this is a bargain!!" "We've got the best armor and weapons, the likes of which you 
won't find anywhere else." "But it's first come first served, so get yours now!" "Step right up! You there, don't just stand around outside." "Go on in! Come on! Don't be shy, step right up!" "I'll never know why he wanted to open a store in a dead town 
like this. What's up with him……? …sigh……" 
"Oh…… there's not much time left!! You never know when that 
moon is gonna come crashing down!!" "When it all comes down to it, this world's about money and 
material things!" "If you got 'em, you can get by whenever, wherever!" "Gotta buy!! Gotta buy, buy, buy!! I'm gonna shop till I drop!" 
"Welcome to the charity store, a store of love and courage! What 
can I get you today?" : "Thank you very much! Please come again." 
"Everything must come to an end. And someday it's gonna be your 
turn. Even the world's gotta end sometime." "Everybody leaves at one time or another. And everyone gets left 
also. That's just fate…" "It's sad, but there's nothing that can be done about it. So 
that's why I'm prayin' like this for all of you." 
"You say you don't know when the stars are gonna fall outta the 
sky? Is that for real?"
"I still don't believe it! How could this be happen?" 
"Ancient Weapon? End of the world? I don't know nothing about 
that! I'm gonna live to be a hundred!" "There's tons of stuff I still gotta do! This's just ths 
beginning." "And what have Shinra and SOLDIER done about it? Tell me! They're 
a waste!!" 
"Actually, I'm a beautiful maid. I just work here in the 
accessory store part-time." "Everything here can compare with the best goods anywhere. So, 
how about one?" : "Thank you. Stop by again." 
(Tifa hears a small squeak when she steps on a spot next to a house. She 
bends down) 
Tifa: "Huh……? What could that be?" "There's something stuck deep inside that looks like a key… 
it's hard to get out." "Well, I'll just let it go for now……" 
(Tifa moves further into the town. She sees a small dog sitting in the 
shadows.) 
Tifa: "What's the matter? Are you all alone?" 
 
Tifa: "You got lost didn't you? Separated from someone you love……? 
Silly thing…" 
 
"……guess it's been about a week now since he washed up here 
on the shore… Poor pokey-headed young thing…" 
 
"It was really sad…… but weird. He was holding this really 
long sword." "I dunno. The whole thing feels unlucky to me. But the amazing 
thing was those weird blue eyes….." 
Tifa: "Wha!?" 
 
Tifa: "Wh…… wait a minute!! What did you just say!?" "Excuse me! That young person you were just talking about……" 
"Yeah… a villager found him a little ways down the coast… 
It was about a week ago I think." 
"Yeah, poor kid… He must've drifted from somewhere pretty far 
away…" 
Tifa: "Cloud!! It must be!! It's Cloud!!" 
Cid: "Heh, good job, Tifa." 
Barret: "You sure!?" 
Tifa: "So where is he? Is he safe!? Where is he now……?" 
 
"Yeah… up ahead here… At the, uh, clinic……" 
Tifa: "He's alive…!" "Cloud…… Cloud's alive!!" "Cloud!!" 
 
Barret: "Uh….? Yo, Tifa!" 
 
Tifa: "Cloud!?" 
 
Doctor: "Here now. The way you're
running around here, you'd think Meteor fell or something." 
Tifa: "I'm sorry, but I heard that a friend of mine was being taken care 
of here……" 
 
Doctor: "A friend…?" 
 
Doctor: "Oh yeah……! That young fellow!?" "Don't worry. Your friend is next door. But I'm afraid his 
condition is…" 
 
Tifa: "Here?" 
 
Tifa: "Over here." 
(She runs into the next room. A nurse is taking care of someone in a 
wheelchair, hidden behind her.) 
Tifa: "Cloud…!?" 
(The nurse moves. We see that the person in the wheelchair is indeed 
Cloud. His head is in his lap. The others come running in.) 
Tifa: "Oh… Cloud!! I'm so glad you're safe!?" 
(She runs up to him. Cloud raises his head to meet her… and it falls 
down again. His head bobs like a children's toy. He looks around as if 
confused.) 
Tifa: "……!?" "Cloud……?" 
Cloud: "Uh…… aaa……?" 
 
Tifa: "Wh…… what's wrong…… Cloud……?" 
Cloud: "A…… Gurk……?" 
 
Tifa: "Cloud! What happened to you…..!?" 
 
Doctor: "Mako poisoning…… Quite an advanced case……" "It appears this young man's been exposed to a high level of Mako 
energy for a protracted period of time." "He probably has no idea who or where he is now……" "Poor fellow, his voice doesn't even work. He is literally miles 
away from us." "Some place far away where no one's ever been… All alone……" 
 
Tifa: "Doctor……!!" 
Cid: "Damn…… that's evil." 
Barret: "That's bad……" 
Tifa: "Cloud……" 
 
Doctor: "Ahem! Let us excuse ourselves." 
 
Doctor: "Listen, would you all mind……… waiting outside?" 
Barret: "………" 
(They all leave Tifa alone with Cloud. The screen dims slightly. Tifa 
leans her head against his knees, crying.) 
Tifa: "Why……? What do you want me to do?" "Please, Cloud…… Talk to me……" "Tell me you see me, that you can hear me…… Tell me, 
please……" 
 
Tifa: "I came this far believing in the memories we have together…" "This isn't happening……! This is too cruel……" 
 
Tifa: "Oh, Cloud……! I………" 
  

 
Barret: "So what about him? You know…… Cloud?" 
 
"I'll say it again, he's got Mako poisoning. I've never seen a 
case this bad…" "An immense amount of Mako-drenched knowledge was put into his 
brain all at once……" "No normal human could have survived it…… It's a miracle he 
did!" 
Barret: "No wonder…… After fallin' in the Lifestream an' bein' washed 
up here………" 
"But remember, the light of hope can be found anywhere." "Listen, if you give up hope… What will happen to him?" 
 
Barret: "……hope……" "Hey, but honestly, man…… Do I really want him to come back?" "What did he do for this world? What can he do for us from here 
on out? He may be nothing more than Sephiroth's shadow……" 
"Is something wrong?" 
 
Barret: "No, nothin'. Nothin' at all, doc." 
 
Tifa: "………" 
 
Barret: "You okay?" 
Tifa: "Yes…… I'm sorry I had you all worried." "And I have something I want to tell you all……" 
(She goes back into the clinic. Everyone follows her. When the others 
arrive inside, Tifa is standing near Cloud, facing away.) 
Tifa: "I don't care about anything else, only Cloud……" 
 
Tifa: "I…… want to be by his side……" 
Cid: "Yeah. Right. Hang in there, Tifa." 
Barret: "Yeah, that's probably best……" "For Cloud…… an' for you……" 
 
Tifa: "I'm sorry, everyone… At a time like this……" 
 
Cid: "Don't worry. I'll stop by again sometime." 
Barret: "You take care now, Tifa. And take care of Cloud." 
Tifa: "Right……" 
 
Barret: "Oh, and uh, Tifa… I don't like askin' this but……" "Is he really your childhood friend? And not Sephiroth's shadow?" 
 
Tifa: "Huh!? Well… that is……" 
 
Tifa: "No, I'm sure of it!" 
 
Barret: "Yeah……? Okay then…… Sorry for askin' that." 
Cid: "Now, we gotta be headin' back to the Highwind." 
  
   
Shinra's Plans Cid's Election 
(The party is gathered on the bridge of the Highwind. Barret gazes out 
the front bay window; Cid sits sprawled on the floor.) 
Barret: "What're we gonna do now? What can WE do?" 
 
Barret: "Huh? Ain't there nothin' we can do?" "An' don' go tellin' us to wait for Cloud to get better." 
Cait-Sith: "Oh, I've got some news." 
Barret: "Yeah, what!? That you a spy?" 
 
Cait-Sith: "Yeah…… I've already told you I was." 
 
Cait-Sith: "Both Gya ha ha and Kya ha ha are up to something." "Wanna eavesdrop?"
(The  fades to black. It fades back in to the Shinra board room. 
Heidegger and Palmer are seated at the table. Reeve stands in the 
background. President Rufus flips his hair, then turns to face them.) 
Rufus: "Now then…… We're faced with two issues." "1. Destroy Meteor. 2. Remove the barrier around North Cave and
defeat Sephiroth." 
 
Rufus: "Any ideas?" 
Heidegger: "Gya haah hah hah! We already solved the first problem!" "Meteor will soon be smashed to bits!" "The plan has already been put in motion. Namely, to collect 
Huge Materia from each region." 
Rufus: "Well……" 
 
Scarlet: "Huge Materia is a high density special type of materia made 
through a special compression process in Mako reactors." 
 
Scarlet: "The energy extracted from it is 330 times the strength of normal 
materia." "Ha, ha, ha! How about that!?" 
 
Scarlet: "We will gather all the Huge Materia together and ram it into 
Meteor." 
 
Scarlet: "That will cause a huge explosion!! Reducing Meteor literally to 
bits." 
Rufus: "You're going to ram into Meteor?" "Do you think we have the technology to do it?" 
Scarlet: "Don't worry about that!" "More importantly, we've got to collect Huge Materia from each area." 
Heidegger: "We've already collected materia from Nibelheim." "All that's left is "Corel" and "Fort Condor"." "I've already dispatched troops to Corel." "Ghaa haah hah hah!" 
 
Barret: "Corel!" "What else can they do to Corel!?" 
Red XIII: "And the Huge Materia……" "You mean the Huge Materia, don't you? I've heard about it." "When our small materia hears the larger one, something should 
happen." "I'm certain of it." "That's why we're using the power of materia in our fight……" 
Barret: "Can't let Shinra get a hold of the Huge Materia!" "Besides, when Cloud gets back, I wanna show him his Huge Materia. 
He's gonna be shocked." 
 
Cait-Sith: "So, what are you saying, Barret?" "Even though you're always knocking him, you really want Cloud to 
return." 
 
Barret: "I ain't sayin' nothin' 'bout nothin'. You just… shut your 
face!" "Every group's gotta have a leader." 
 
Barret: "An' that's me!" "Or at least I wanna be… But I ain't cut out to be no leader." "I never knew that till lately." 
 
Barret: "An' that's what is……" 
 
Cid: "……ZZZZ…… hmph?" 
 
Cid: "Wha? What's goin' on?" 
 
Barret: "You been chosen to be the new leader." 
Cid: "Pain in the ass. Forget it." 
Barret: "But for us to fight, we gotta have Highwind, and you." 
 
Barret: "We need it to save the Planet. An' who's runnin' this ship? You!" "That's why you're our new leader. Ain't no one else can." 
 
Cid: "Hm….. this ship's gonna save the Planet, huh? Ain't that gonna 
be just a little tough?" 
 
Cid: "Oh man, that went straight to my heart." "I'm a man, too!" "Okay, I'll do it! Everyone, follow me!" 
 
Barret: "Awright, now here's the first job." "The Operation Room's waiting for
you!" 
Cid: "Yeah!!" 
(He practically scampers off to the the Operation Room. Barret runs after 
him) 
Barret: "Yo, Cid!" "When you're ready, we're headin'
for the Corel Reactor. C'mon Mr. leader, you'd better hurry." 
   
Corel's Huge Materia 
People on the Highwind 
"Looks like you turned out to be the leader after all, 
Captain……" 
"Good day, Captain!" 
Cait-Sith: "Hmmn, the Huge Materia is at Corel, Fort Condor……" "I'm sure there was another place that had it. Where was 
that……?" 
Red XIII: "Cid." "Let's visit Cloud and Tifa from time to time." 
Barret: "Yo, Mr. Leader! Get your pilot ass up here!" 
 
People in North Corel 
"Shinra soldiers came around sayin' they were gatherin' up all 
the Huge Materia." "I think they're gonna bring it here by coal train, from the 
Corel Reactor."  

"Hey, what's gonna happen to the world…?" "I guess no one wants to have fun anymore now that the Gold 
Saucer is closing…" 
"The next train's coming in soon." 
"With Meteor coming, I guess it won't make any difference…"
"I want to leave this garbage dump of a town behind me, and 
start a new life." "If I had a buggy, I'd cross the southern desert, and go to that 
town across the river…" 
"Everyone knows that accident couldn't have been avoided." "But no one will be satisfied until someone takes the blame." 
"There was something glowing in that well over there." "If I can get my hands on it, I'm gonna sell it and go to the 
Gold Saucer!" 
(Cid heads north to the Corel Reactor. Two Shinra guards at the entrance 
accost them.) 
"You guys are…!" 
 
Cid: "Guess we're safe for now…!" 
 
Red XIII: "Ohh!" 
Barret: "Da---mn!" 
(They scatter to avoid the train as it rumbles out of the reactor towards 
Corel.) 
Cid: "Looks like they're takin' off with the Huge Materia in that 
train!" 
Barret: "NO! You damn boneheads!" 
Red XIII: "Did the Shinra beat us!?" 
Cid: "Hey, do you know who I am?" "I'm Cid that's who the hell I am! Now just let me handle it!"
(They follow Cid as he runs into the Reactor. We hear another train 
whistle.) 
Cid: "Hey, hey, hey, hey---!" 
(Another small train, driven by Cid, trundles out of the reactor in 
pursuit. The  switches to the engineer's compartment.) 
Barret: "How can they even drive this?" 
Cid: "Don't ask me… I don't know!" 
Barret: "What!?" 
 
Cid: "Don't worry! I can handle this kinda stuff!" "Two levers; one on the right and one on the left…"
 
Cid: "I see, just alternate the two levers up and down, right!?" "Judging from the enemy's speed, I'd say it'll take about 10 
minutes." "We're gonna fly!! Hold on tight!!" 
(Cid, controlled by the PLAYER, begins to alternately flip the levers 
back and forth. The train gains speed until it catches up with the enemy 
train on the other track.) 
Cid: "All right! We're gonna jump!!"
(The party makes a flying leap and lands on the last car of the train. 
They leap from car to car, battling minibosses, until they reach the head 
locomotive. A Shinra soldier is piloting the train.) 
"What the! You… you guys!" 
Cid: "All right- Just hand over the Huge Materia!" 
"Sh……" "Whooooa----!" 
 
Cid: "You got guts comin' after me!" "I'll never forget you!" 
Barret: "Got no time for that now!" 
Red XIII: "We got it going, but what about the brakes?" 
Cid: "I KNOW, already! Just shut up and keep quiet! If we keep this 
up, we'll crash right into North Corel!" "Let's see… if we alternately use the levers to accelerate…" "It should brake if we move the levers up or down simultaneously!" 
(Cid, controlled by the PLAYER, moves both levers up. The train gains 
speed.)
Barret: "Hey, it's not working!" 
Red XIII: "We're gaining speed!" 
Cid: "^%#@! The other way!? Just watch, this time, I'll…" 
 
Barret: "Hey… HEY HEY!" 
Cid: "SHI-------!!" 
(He jams both levers down once more until they snap off. FMV sequence as 
the train rolls to a stop scant inches from North Corel. Cid receives the 
Huge Materia.)
People in North Corel 
"You sure are brave. I'm impressed!" 
"You guys are really something!" 
(The camera pans over to show many citizens of North Corel come out of 
their homes to meet the party.) 
"Aren't you the ones that stopped the Shinra Train?" "The Shinra was just about to destroy our lives again…" 
"It might be full of junk, but this is the only home we got, 
Barret!!" 
Barret: "Of… of course! We're all born and raised in the coal mines!!" "No matter how tough it gets, our hearts burn bright red like 
coal!" 
"To hell with Meteor! We're Coal Miners, ain't we?" "We'll dig a deep tunnel and hide from the Meteor!" 
"That's it!" 
 
"Hey, kid! How about givin' somethin' to these guys fighting the 
Shinra?" 
 
"I got it out of the well. Isn't it an amazing rock!!" 
 
"Must've been a horrific battle. You have scars all over your 
body." "I already talked to the Inn's owner, today you can rest for 
free." 
 
People in North Corel 
"Whenever I look up in the sky, I see Meteor staring me right in 
the face……" "If you're comin' down, then hurry up do it!! 'Cause I'm gonna 
kick the $#@& outta ya!" 
"What the? Don't get hit by the train!" 
"You saved my life. Not that I have much longer to live anyway…" 
"When I grow up, I'm gonna travel the world collecting glowing 
stones!" 
"I figure if I stay alive long enough, something good's bound to 
happen." 
  
   
Fort Condor's Huge Materia 
(Cid and the party travel to Fort Condor A huge, majestic bird perches 
atop it. A doorman greets them as they arrive.) 
"We've been fighting the Shinra for a long time at this 
battlefield." "Even now, we're still settled in for a long war with them." "If you aren't in a hurry, would you help us fight them?" "Listen I don't want to push but, if you've got something else 
to do, why don't you finish that first?" 
Like to help but… I guess we'll help you 
Cid: Like to help but… 
"All right then…… Take care of yourselves…" 
Cid: I guess we'll help you 
"Really!? Then go on up and they'll fill you in on the details." 
 
<//>
(Climbing a rope ladder, Cid enters the main room of Fort Condor, where 
they meet an older man sitting at a wood table.) 
"Hmmn, now this is something. I never thought anyone would climb 
up here." "Any minute now, this will be a battlefield against Shinra. You'd 
better get down before you get involved." 
Cid: "A battlefield, we can't overlook that." 
Barret: "Shinra? The hell those jackasses doing here?" 
Red XIII: "Shinra again." 
"It appears you have a problem with Shinra, too. After all, you 
climbed up here." "Why not listen to what I have to say for a moment?" 
Cid: "All right, talk on!" 
"Do you know what's at the top of this mountain?" 
Barret: "Huh? Something's up there?" 
Cid: "No matter how you look at it, that's a reactor. And on top of 
it, is that the Condor?" 
"I can see you're very perceptive. Yes, it's a reactor and a 
condor." "Looks like there's a special materia up in the Mako reactor." "Then came the condor, so Shinra dispatched the troops to get rid 
of it." "Their plan is to get rid of the condor and the people on this 
mountain and to get the materia from the Mako Reactor." "Unfortunately, we don't have the ability to fight Shinra 
ourselves." "That's why we have hired soldiers to help us." "As our sponsor you can help us with a contribution or by 
fighting alongside of us…" "What do you think? You want to join us in our fight?" 
Cid: "If you go that far, what can I say. Well, we'll be able to do 
something if you leave it to us." 
Barret: "Hey! We'll come to the rescue." 
Red XIII: "Got it. I'm gonna lend a hand,
too." 
 
People in Fort Condor 
"I'm begging you. Please prevent the reactor from being destroyed 
and the condors from being killed." 
"Hello. Do your best. We will, too."  
"You hang in there!"  
(The party climbs another rope ladder to the top floor. A lookout surveys 
the area outside through a window.) 
"So shall I let you in on our strategy?" "The enemy is targeting this mountain's reactor and will be 
climbing to reach it." "We must set a trap and hire soldiers to protect the place." "Well, this is all we have…… this village doesn't have any 
money. Even if we wanted to fight, our hands are tied 'cause we're broke." "To hire one soldier, we need 400 gil. So, if we have 20 
soldiers, we must have 8000 gil." "That is, we would like you to use your own money to hire these 
soldiers, buy the trap, set it up and give the commands." "We know that we're asking is selfish. We sent out our wives and 
kids to another village. We are resigned to our fate." "Let's get it back to square one. If the enemy penetrates this 
shed, you'll have to fight them off immediately." "I know it's a one shot deal, but I'm asking for your help." "Now then, is there anything you wish to ask?" 
 
"Ready?" 
Wait: Okay, ready: Hear more 
Cid: Wait 
Cid: Okay, ready 
 
Cid: Hear more
 

"This is the deciding battle. The enemy numbers more than ever 
before." 
(The battle begins. This minigame is a Warcraft-style real-time strategy 
game, in which you buy your own soldiers and attack the enemy, trying to 
prevent them from reaching the top of the fort. It's a long battle, but 
eventually they win. The  shifts back to the lookout post.) 
"YES! We did it! That was wonderful! Thank you!! I doubt Shinra 
will attack now." 
 
"A, arrgghh……" 
(FMV sequence. The sky around the Fort darkens, and the egg the condor is 
protecting cracks, then hatches. A sphere of light envelops the condor, 
then it bursts into flame. The energy fades, and the condor screeches and 
tumbles off the side of the tower.) 
"Th, that light just now…… The condor…… The eggs……" "What!? Would you go outside and see what it was?" 
(Cid goes out to the roof of the tower. He finds that the egg has indeed 
hatched, and a not-so-tiny baby condor is sitting in the now-empty nest. 
Cid grabs a Pheonix summon materia from the ground. The baby chirps, flaps 
its wings, and clumsily takes flight. Cid goes back inside.) 
"Gone…" "Be sure and report to my father, too." 
 
"Everyone, thanks. I really mean it. Thanks." "Although there isn't anything we can give you, we'll make sure 
you can stop in and stay any time, so be sure to drop by." "Yes, yes, and there's one thing I forgot to tell you……" 
 
Cid: "Huh? What's this?" 
Barret: "Damn man, it's Huge Materia." 
"The truth is, this is the matera inside the reactor." 
Cid: "What the hell did we fight for?" 
"We weren't protectin' the reactor, we were protectin' the 
condors." "When that reactor was built, they forced us to help. That's how 
we knew what was inside the reactor." "I knew this day would come, so after the Shinra left, I sneaked 
in and took the materia." "I didn't mean to fool you, but I guess that's how it ended up. 
I'm really sorry." 
Cid: "Just forget about it. Anyway, we're still alive." 
"I see. If you put it that way…… we're really grateful." 
Cid: "So the last Huge Materia that Shinra's after's in the underwater 
reactor in Junon?" 
Barret: "We gotta get there first and beat'em no matter what!" 
Cid: "But ya know, Shinra's probably on high alert since we always 
mess with 'em." "How 'bout we take a break and go see that little fella for a 
bit?" 
Barret: "You mus' mean Cloud……" 
Cid: "Yeah, I'm worried aobut Tifa; she may've collapsed takin' care 
of the guy." "How about checkin' on 'em? Down to Mideel!" 
(Several thousand gil poorer but one Huge Materia richer, they leave Fort 
Condor and head to Mideel.)  
   
Weapon Attacks Lifestream Revisited 
(Cid and the others arrive in Mideel. The first sound that meets their 
ears is that of the homeless dog's whimpering. It comes trotting up to 
them as soon as they arrive and rolls over at their feet. They hurry to 
the clinic; the dog following close behind.) 
Doctor: "I'm sorry…… But your friend's condition remains 
unchanged……" "You'll have to be patient and wait this out. These things take 
time. Just like fine wine, time is of the essence."
(They go to the next room. Tifa still watches over Cloud. Cloud still bobs 
his head.) 
Tifa: "……It's no use…… I don't understand a thing, Cloud." "What should I do……? What if you never recover for the rest 
of your life?" 
 
Tifa: "Eyaaah!?" 
 
Cloud: "……They're…… They're…… coming……!!" 
 
Cid: "What did you say, Cloud!?" 
Cloud: "Uh…… aaa……?" 
 
Cid: "Damn. What the hell's goin' on!?"
(He rushes out, passing the doctor and nurse, taking a duck-and-cover 
position. Outside, the entire area quakes and flashes randomly red and 
yellow.) 
Cid: "What's this…!?" "The Lifestream is gushing up from below the surface of the 
earth!" 
 
Cid: "Damn, that's……!? This is bad…..!!" 

 
Tifa: "Cid……!? What's wrong?" 
Cid: "N, nothin'!! You and Cloud get inside quick!!" 
Tifa: "But I……!?" 
 
Cid: "Hey, don't worry about a thing. I ain't about to die that 
easily."
Tifa: "Be careful…!" 
 
Cid: "Okay, here I go! Watch this!!" 
(Cid runs to the town square. The camera moves to show the Ultimate Weapon 
circling in the sky overhead.) 
Cid: "Damn!! That &%$^%$
Weapon!!" "Of all the times to show up……!" 

Cid: "OK then, come on!! You
&$^%$!" 
 
(The camera pans to show the Weapon circle once more, lazily, then mosey 
off.) 
Cid: "You &^$#&$#! You tryin' to escape?" 
(The Weapon releases one more cry and flash of energy before departing. 
The camera pans back down to the party.) 
Barret: "Damn, man. Just a little bit more an' I wouldda smashed 
him……" 
Red XIII: "It looks like the Lifestream has settled as well." 
 
Cid: "Damn, you gotta be kiddin'……!!" 
(The ground begins to quake more violently as the screen flashes more 
chaotically than before.) 
Cid: "Th, this's bad……! The main stream is kickin' up!!" "Somethin' way bigger that that last one is on its way!!" "No good!! Get outta here……!!" 
Red XIII: "But what about Tifa and Cloud!?" 
Cid: "Goddammit!!" "You don't have time to worry about anyone other than yourself! 
You don't know when that stream'll blow……"
 
Cid: "Whoa!!" "There's no time, hurry!!" 
 
Cid: "Tifa!! Cloud!! Get outta here!!" 
 
Tifa: "This is bad…… The tremors are getting worse."
 
Tifa: "Wait a minute, Cloud." 
 
Tifa: "Doctor! Shouldn't we move him somewhere rather than stay 
here…?" 
 
Doctor: "Hmm…… It might be safer to take refuge in a wide open 
space." 
 
Tifa: "Don't you worry about a thing, Cloud……" "I'll see to it that you get somewhere safe!" 
 
Doctor: "No! The structure can't take it!! Hurry!" 
Tifa: "Yes!" 
 
Tifa: "Ready Cloud? We're leaving now!!" 
(Bob bob. Tifa wheels him out. FMV sequence as Tifa wheels Cloud out of 
Mideel. The ground behind them cracks, then collapses, the gaps following 
them closer and closer. Just as they are about to exit the village, a 
whole section of ground gives, tilts, and falls into the Lifestream, 
taking Tifa and Cloud with it. The camera follows them down, Cloud's face 
expressionless, as they land without a splash in the rippling green of the 
Lifestream.) 
   
Into Darkness 
(Tifa and Cloud slowly float downward through the green Lifestream. The 
green fades and Tifa is left spinning, somehow artificially, in black 
space. She slowly comes to a stop, then sits up as if she were sitting in 
a chair.) 
Tifa: "Wh, where am I……? What's happening? I……?" 
 
Tifa: "Where's Cloud……!? Cloud, where are you!?" 
 
Tifa: "Huh…… what……? Who……?" 
 
Tifa: "Who is it……? I can't hear……" 
 
Tifa: "Wait a minute……! I don't know anything about that!" 
 
Tifa: "No! It's not me……! I'd never do anything like that!!" 
(She stands still a moment. The sounds continue. Then she clutches her 
ears and shakes her head violently.) 
Tifa: "No! Stop it……!! Stay back!" 
(She begins to run in a random direction, not getting anywhere but to more 
blackness.) 
Tifa: "Somebody…… help! Please!!" 
(She stops, her body lit up fire-red. The sounds change, becoming 
something like radio static, intermixed with the sound of machine gun fire. 
She drops to her knees, clutching her head.) 
Tifa: "Cloud, help me!!" 
 
Tifa: "Eyaaaaghh……!!" 
  
   
Enter Cloud's Mind Nibelheim, Long Ago 
(The blackness fades. We see Tifa stand up, slowly. She is on a great 
green platform, suspended in space. The screen is dimmed slightly. Planets 
and stars are born and die in the background. Three paths lead away from 
the platform. On each one sits a twin of Cloud, his head on his knees.) 
Tifa: "………… Where am I……?" 
(The screen brightens. Tifa spins and looks up to see another Cloud, high 
above the platform. He is tranparent. He clutches his head, writhing in 
slow motion, suspended in midair.) 
Tifa: "Cloud!?" "What is it, Cloud? What is this……!?" 
 
Tifa: "Is this the inside of your dream? Or is it…… your…… 
subconsciousness……?" 
 
Tifa: "You're searching, aren't you, Cloud?" "Searching…… for yourself……" "I can help too. We'll work together to try and get the real you 
back!" 
 
Tifa: "But…… Where do we start……?" 
(She speaks to the replica of Cloud sitting to the north. Past him, we see 
the gates of Nibelheim, faded slightly, as if in a dream.) 
"The gates of Nibelheim… Five years ago, Sephiroth passed 
through these gates……" "And…… That's how it all started……" 
Tifa: "It connects…… to Nibelheim……?" "That's right… It's probably best to start from there……" 
 
Tifa: "Let's go have a look, Cloud. I know it's not easy…… But I'll 
be right with you……" 
(FMV sequence. The camera floats past Tifa and Cloud to the gates of 
Nibelheim. Tifa arrives there.) 
Tifa: "Cloud… look." 
 
Tifa: "Here's the well…" 
 
Tifa: "And that's Gramps' Inn, too." 
(She runs back through the gates, stopping by a rusted old truck reposing 
there.) 
Tifa: "The only truck in town. It's been here since we were little 
kids, right?" 
 
Tifa: "This is the Nibelheim you remember, right?" 
 
Tifa: "It's the same as my Nibelheim That's why this place is… our 
Nibelheim."
(Cloud materializes from thin air, seated restfully on the ground. He 
stands, looking at his feet as Tifa comes over to him.) 
Tifa: "Five years ago… two men from SOLDIER came…" 
 
Tifa: "Sephiroth and…… a young and vibrant soldier." 
 
Tifa: "Can you tell me again what happened?" 
(Cloud blinks out of existence, then reappears behind Tifa, still staring 
at his feet. She moves aside as Sephiroth comes into the town. He stands 
in the gates a moment, then turns back. He takes no notice of Cloud and 
Tifa as this movie of Cloud's memories plays out.) 
Sephiroth: "So how does it feel?" 
Tifa: "Five years ago… I saw the real Sephiroth for the very first 
time." 
Sephiroth: "It's your first time back to your hometown in a long time, 
right?" "So how does it feel?" "I wouldn't know because I don't have a hometown…" 
Cloud: "Ummm… how 'bout your parents?" 
Tifa: "So this is… the Great Sephiroth." 
Sephiroth: "My mother is Jenova. She died right after she gave birth to me. 
My father…" 
 
Tifa: "But to tell you the truth, I thought he was very cold." 
Sephiroth: "What does it matter…?" "All right, let's go." 
 
Tifa: "I remember, I felt a foreboding about him." 
(She turns to watch as the Cloud of five years ago, flanked by two 
soldiers, enters. The soldier on the right stops to occupy the same space 
as the present Cloud. He walks through the soldier, to the other Cloud, 
turns, and seems to meld with him as they both occupy the same space. The 
present and past Clouds flash subtly. Tifa shakes her head.) 
Tifa: "No, Cloud." 
 
Tifa: "I've been hiding it for some time, afraid that if I told you… 
something terrible might happen." "But, I'm not going to hide anything anymore." 
(With a white flash, Sephiroth, the guards, and the past Cloud disappear, 
leaving only Cloud and Tifa.) 
Tifa: "You weren't here. Cloud did not come to Nibelheim five years 
ago." 
(She turns away. Cloud looks at the ground. With a white flash, the Tifa 
of then, in her kawaii cowboy hat, appears, sitting on the ground. She is 
slumped over, staring at the ground, perhaps playing with a pebble or a 
blade of grass.) 
Tifa: "I… waited. But, Cloud… never came." 
 
Tifa: "The two that were ordered here were Sephiroth and another 
person…" 
(The Tifa of then stands up and dashes off into the town, not headed 
anywhere in particular. Sephiroth appears before Tifa once more.) 
Sephiroth: "All right, let's go." 
(He turns and walks into Nibelheim. As the screen fades to white, we catch 
a glimpse of the two soldiers and the young man with black hair, in 
Cloud's place, follow him.)  
   
That Childhood Promise… 
(The  fades in to the green platform of Cloud's mind. The gates of 
Nibelheim are no longer there. The Cloud that sat there speaks with Tifa.) 
"You mean that member of SOLDIER who came with Sephiroth 
wasn't…… Cloud……?" 
Tifa: "There's nothing……… I can say……" "You must find the answer yourself……" 
 
Tifa: "If you can't…… Then you……" "Take your time, Cloud. Slowly…… little by little, okay?" 
(The Cloud of Nibelheim slowly turns away. Tifa speaks to the Cloud to the 
left. Beyond him, we see the well in Nibelheim, slightly washed-out. The 
Cloud stands up.) 
"That starry night at the well…… And our promise that 
night… What if the memory was just a lie?" 
Tifa: "Don't hurry, Cloud…… Don't answer too quickly." "Just keep checking all those small emotions and it'll come 
back…… Slowly…… little by little……" "Right… like the sky that night…… the heavens were filled 
with stars……" 
(FMV sequence. Cloud and Tifa float up into space as the camera flybys to 
the well at Nibelheim , ending focused on the starry night sky. The  
fades to black.) 
Tifa: "From the beginning… OK?" 
(The  fades in to the well, that night when Tifa and Cloud were just 
children. They stand on the well, Cloud staring at the ground.) 
Tifa: "Try and remember, Cloud." 
(Cloud, a child, materializes. He is sitting on the edge of the well, 
dangling his feet. Then Tifa, also a child, is there too, sitting across 
from him, exactly as on that night long ago.) 
Tifa: "Right, I was wearing these clothes." "That's you, too. You were so small then……"
 
Tifa: "…and cute." 
(She and her younger self both look at their respective versions of Cloud, 
in perfect sync.) 
Tifa: "Sephiroth once said…" 

 
Tifa: "Cloud made up his memories by listening to my stories…." 
 
Tifa: "Did you imagine this sky? No, you remembered it." 
 
Tifa: "That night the stars were gorgeous. It was just Cloud and I. We 
talked at the well…" "That's why I continued to believe that you were the real 
Cloud." 
 
Tifa: "I still believe you're the Cloud from Nibelheim…" 
(In a flash, Young Cloud disappears and reappears at the highest structure 
of the well, silhouetted against the night sky.) 
Tifa: "But you don't believe in yourself…" 
(Tifa and her child self both cross their legs in perfect sync, as if they 
were the same being. The present Tifa leans back to look up at young 
Cloud. The screen pans up and fades to white.) 
Tifa: "These memories aren't enough."  
   
Jealousy In My Room 
(The screen fades back in and we are back in Cloud's subconscious. The 
Nibelheim well is no longer visible.) 
Tifa: "Cloud, what about your other memories?" 
 
Tifa: "No, not memories." "A memory is something that has to be consciously recalled, 
right?" "That's why sometimes it can be mistaken and a different 
thing……" 
 
Tifa: "But it's different from a memory locked deep within your 
heart……" "That's why it must be a fake. If he could recall up that 
memory……" "That's it! What about some memory that has to do with me?" 
 
Tifa: "I say something and you don't remember it……" "But you say something, and I remember it, too… Then we'll know 
that's our memory……" 
 
Tifa: "Talk to me. About anything, some important memory to you…" "Now that you mention it, why did you want to join SOLDIER in the 
first place?" "I always thought it was a sudden decision you made……" 
 
"……I was devastated. ……I wanted to be noticed." 
 
"……I was devastated. ……I wanted to be noticed." 
 
"I thought if I got stronger I could get someone to 
notice………" 
 
Tifa: "Someone has to notice you…? ……who?" 
 
"Who………? ……You know who! ……You, that's who." 
 
"You……" 
Tifa: "……Me? Why!?" 
"Tifa…… did you forget…… about those days?" 
 
Tifa: "Look…… I……" 
 
Tifa: "I'm sorry…… But what are you talking about?" 
(For the first time, we see Cloud, as a teenager, leap down from a high 
stone column near the place where Nibelheim once could be seen.) 
"No…… it's all right. You were having a hard time back then." 
 
"You were so busy with your own things, it's only natural you 
don't remember me back then." 
 
Tifa: "'Back then'?" 
"It's important to me…… I hate to say it but…… It's a 
very important memory……" "Do you want to see it?" 
(Teenage Cloud runs over to stand next to the third and final Cloud. Past 
him can be seen a window, without a building past it to look into. Tifa 
speaks to the Cloud seated there.) 
"……a sealed up secret…… wish……" "Tender memories…… no one can ever know………" 
(He slowly stands up and moves out of the way so that Teenage Cloud can 
run past him to stand by the window. Tifa follows him.) 
"Do you want to know where this window goes to, Tifa?" "Fine…… I'll go." 
(FMV sequence. The camera floats past Tifa and Teenage Cloud, through the 
window. We see that the window leads to Tifa's room. Inside, Tifa looks 
around. Both Teenage Cloud and an adult Cloud are there.)
Tifa: "My room?" 
 
Cloud: "It was my first time there." 
Tifa: "Was… it?" 
Cloud: "I only used to look up at it from outside." 
(The screen flashes white. A teenage Tifa is now sitting on the floor at 
the foot of her bed, her head bowed on her knees.. Three boys are standing 
around her.) 
"Hey, look!"
 
"Cloud's coming!" 
(Through the window, we see Young Cloud come running up the path. The boy 
turns to Tifa.) 
"You think he wants to come in?" 
(Tifa looks up a moment, then puts her head back down on her knees. The
present Tifa speaks.) 
Tifa: "Was that the first day you came into my room?" 
 
Tifa: "…that's right." "We lived next to each other." "But I really didn't know you that well." 
 
Tifa: "I've known you since we were children and I always thought we 
were close…" 
(The teenage Tifa looks up, shakes her head, then bows it back down. The 
camera switches back to the overhead view of Tifa's room.) 
Tifa: "Now that you mention it… I don't recall you ever being in my 
room…" 
 
"Tifa always used to be with this three-some." 
Tifa: "…That's right." 
 
"I used to think… they were all stupid." 
 
Tifa: "What?" 
 
"You were all childish, laughing at every little stupid thing." 
(She turns to look at her former self and friends, then back to Young 
Cloud.) 
Tifa: "But we were children, back then." 
 
"…I know. I'm the one that was stupid." "I really wanted to play with everyone, but I was never allowed 
into the group." 
 
"Then later… I began to think I was different…" "That I was different from those immature kids." 
 
"That then… maybe…" 
(A double of the adult Cloud, motionless up to this point, materializes. 
It stands, flashing in and out of existence. Then it speaks. Young Cloud 
doesn't seem to notice.) 
"Just maybe, they would invite me in." 
 
"I thought that might happen, so I hung around…" 
 
"I was so prejudiced. And… weak." 
 
"That night I called Tifa out to the well…" "I thought to myself Tifa would never come, that she hated me." 
 
Tifa: "Yeah… it was so sudden. I was… a bit surprised." 
 
Tifa: "But…" "It's true that we weren't THAT close, but…" 
 
Tifa: "After you left town, I really thought about you a lot." 
 
"I used to wonder how Cloud was doing." "I wonder if Cloud was able to get into SOLDIER?" 
 
Tifa: "I started reading the newspapers, thinking that there might be an 
article about you." 
 
"Thanks, Tifa." "Tell him what you told me, later. He'll probably be so happy." 
 
Tifa: "OK!" "Huh?" 
(She looks at the double, then the original adult Cloud, then back to 
Young Cloud.) 
Tifa: "What happened on this day? Was it a special day?" 
 
"This was the day…" 
 
"Tifa's mother…" 
  
   
On The Other Side Of the Mountain 
Tifa: "The day Mom died…" 
(The screen fades in to show the window once more, and young Tifa sitting 
on the floor, looking very small.) 
Tifa: "I want… to see… mom…" 
 
Tifa: "…I wonder if there's anything beyond that mountain?"
(The camera pans down to show Tifa, surrounded by her three friends, on 
the mountain path. One looks ahead at the mountain, then back to Tifa.) 
"Mt. Nibel is scary. Many people have died there." 
"No one crosses that mountain alive…" 
 
Tifa: "How 'bout those that died?" 
 
Tifa: "Did mama pass through the mountains?" 
 
Tifa: "I'm going!" 
(She spins on her heel and heads down the path. Her friends follow. Two 
of them pause, consult with each other, then one of the them turns and 
goes running home. He bumps into Cloud, who had been following, on the 
way. Cloud runs along the path, pauses to look ahead at Tifa and her two 
remaining friends continuing, then keeps following, out of sight. The 
 fades to the bridge across the deep gorge. Tifa walks resolutely 
across it. Her two friends look at each other, then turn tail and run 
home, again brushing past Cloud. Apprehensively, he takes a step onto the 
bridge, then, without looking back, goes sprinting across it. The screen 
fades to black. When it fades in again, we see young Tifa and young Cloud 
lying crumpled on a white screen. Tifa and Cloud look on. A black 
silhouette of an adult Cloud stands in the center. Tifa goes up to the 
dark Cloud.) 
"I don't remember what path I walked." "Tifa missed her step. I ran to her… but didn't make it in 
time." "Both of us fell off the cliff." "Back then, I only scarred my knees, but……" 
(Tifa's father and another man from the village come running onscreen, 
shocked. Tifa's father picks her up in his arms, while the other screams 
at young Cloud.)
"Cloud! Why'd you bring Tifa to a place like this!" 
 
"What the hell's the matter with you!?" 
 
"What if she dies!?" 
(He walks after Tifa's father, leaving Cloud sitting on the ground. The 
dark Cloud speaks again.) 
"Tifa was in a coma for seven days." "We all thought she wouldn't make it." "If only I could've saved her…" "I was so angry… Angry at myself for my weakness." "Ever since then, I felt Tifa blamed me…" "I got out of control… I'd get into fights not even caring who 
it was." 
 
"That was the first time I heard about Sephiroth." "If I got strong like Sephiroth, then everyone might…"  
   
The Truth You Were Watching Me A Battle of Will 
(The  fades in to Cloud's subconscious. A Cloud still sits on the 
steps to the window, but where young Cloud had once stood, now stands an 
adult Cloud. The dark Cloud stands alongside.) 
"If I could just get stronger…… Then even Tifa would have to 
notice me……" 
 
Tifa: "So that was it……" "Sorry, Cloud." "If I had only remembered more clearly what had happened, I could 
have done something sooner……" 
 
"It's not your fault, Tifa." 
 
Tifa: "But, I remember back when we were eight!" 
 
Tifa: "That's it! Now I know!" 
 
Tifa: "You weren't created five years ago." "My childhood memories weren't all made up!" 
 
Tifa: "Hang in there Cloud! Just a little longer! You've almost found 
the real you!" 
(Both Clouds nod, then touch their faces, in perfect sync, as the same 
being.) 
Tifa: "Let's go back to Nibelheim again……!" 
(The dark Cloud walks into the normal Cloud, melding their bodies with a 
small metallic sound. The resulting adult Cloud runs toward the 
representation of the gates of Nibelheim. Tifa follows him.) 
"The truth is right there. We almost have the answer right in the 
palm of our hands." 
(Tifa runs into Nibelheim and motions for Cloud to follow. As they run 
through the courtyard toward Shinra mansion, Tifa stops.)
Tifa: "Cloud, wait." "Where are you going?" 
 
Cloud: "……The reactor……?" 
 
Cloud: "To the reactor! The Mako reactor of five years ago!" 
(He runs off and Tifa follows. The screen fades to white. It fades in; we 
are at the pod room at the Nibel reactor. Tifa and Sephiroth are at the 
top of the stairs. We see them wrestle briefly with the Masamune, then 
Sephiroth wrenches it away and slashes her as he did five years ago. We 
see her fly backwards, in slow motion, landing, broken, at the bottom of 
the stairs. The black-haired young man, Zack, comes running in, his huge 
sword on his back.)
Tifa: "Hey! It's Cloud!" 
(The camera pans up to show Sephiroth turn without a word and enter 
Jenova's room.) 
Cloud: "Za……ck…… Zac……k. Zack…" 
Tifa: "You remembered!!" 
(Zack rushes, leaving Tifa where she lies, up the stairs, after Sephiroth. 
He sprints into Jenova's room.) 
Tifa: "That's right! It was Zack who came to Nibelheim with Sephiroth!" "Then, where were you, Cloud?"
(After a long, silent pause, Zack flies backward out of Jenova's room, 
landing atop one of the pods, in exactly the same position as Tifa lies.) 
Tifa: "Cloud… Did you… see it all?" 
(There is a flash of white. One of the guards that accompanied Zack runs 
into the pod room. The camera pans wildly as he glances in horror around 
the room.)
Cloud: "I saw…… everything……" 

(The guard dashes up the stairs to where Zack lies atop the pod. He grabs 
Zack's sword and, laying it across his back, dashes up the stairs. Inside 
Jenova's room, he rushes up to Sephiroth. Sephiroth turns just in time to 
stabbed through the stomach by the guard.) 
"Mom… Tifa… my town… give it back…" 
Sephiroth: "Aaarrrgh…… who… who are you?" 
(The guard pulls his sword from Sephiroth's body. Sephiroth kneels down, 
clutching his stomach. The guard slowly backs away, shaking his head.) 
"I had so much respect for you… I admired you…" 
(The camera pans down to show the guard, facing away from Sephiroth and 
looking down at the floor, breathing heavily.) 
Tifa: "Cloud!?" 

Tifa: "That's what happened…" 
(The  fades in to the Mako fountain in the Nibel mountains. Zack 
stands in place of Cloud. Tifa walks toward the fountain, while the guard 
looks on.) 
Tifa: "You were there." "You were watching me." 
(The  shifts to the Mako reactor in the Nibel mountains. The guard 
blocks Tifa from entering the Mako Reactor.) 
Tifa: "Yeah, I remember."
 
Tifa: "Hmm… so it was you." 
 
Zack: "Hey, Cloud. If you're feeling sick, why don't you take that mask 
off?" 
Cloud: "Yeah…" 
(The  fades in. We are on the truck carrying Zack and Sephiroth in 
search of their monster. The carsick guard is Cloud.) 
Cloud: "Yeah… this is… me." "I… never made it as a member of SOLDIER." 
(The carsick Cloud slumps down as Zack walks energetically around the back 
of the truck, doing squat thrusts and the like.) 
Cloud: "I even left my hometown telling everyone I was going to join, 
but…" "I was so embarrassed…… I didn't want to see anybody." 
(The  fades to the gates of Nibeheim. Sephiroth enters the town, 
followed by Zack, flanked by two guards. One guard is Cloud; he has 
forgotten his helmet. He runs offscreen, then returns, masked.) 
Sephiroth: "How does it feel?" "It's your first time back to your hometown in a long time, 
right?"
(The  fades to the Nibelheim courtyard. Every building is in flames. 
The guard that was lying outside of Cloud's house moves a little.) 
Cloud: "I'm…" 
(The  fades to the pod room at the Nibel reactor. Cloud, his helmet 
off, exits Jenova's room.) 
Tifa: "…You came. …You kept your promise." 
(Cloud comes down the stairs and lifts Tifa's broken body. He gently 
lays her down against one of the pods.)
Tifa: "So you really did come when I was in trouble!" 
Cloud: "Sorry… I didn't get there… fast enough…" 
Tifa: "It's all right… Cloud." 
(The camera pans up to show Sephiroth exit Jenova's room, her decapitated 
head in one hand.) 
Sephiroth: "Just like you." 
(He descends the stairs, Jenova's head swinging back and forth, and leaves 
the pod room. Cloud gets up and prepares to follow, but Zack catches him 
as he leaves.) 
Zack: "Cloud… Kill Sephiroth…" 
(Cloud nods and leaves the pod room. The  shifts to the entryway of 
the reactor. Sephiroth walks determinedly out of the reactor, despite his 
wound to the stomach. Cloud exits the pod room as Sephiroth reaches the 
walkway across the Mako pit of the reactor, the hole in the Lifestream.) 
Cloud: "Sephiroth!" 
(Sephiroth stops, then looks back over his shoulder at Cloud. Cloud rushes 
him, preparing to kill. Sephiroth neatly stabs Cloud through the chest 
with the Masamune. He lifts the sword, and Cloud with it, off the ground.) 
Sephiroth: "Don't… push… your luck…" 
(Cloud dangles there for a few moments, then by sheer will alone, brings 
himself back to the ground. Sephiroth's sword arm begins to tremble. Cloud 
reaches up and grasps the sharp edge of the Masamune.) 
Sephiroth: "…It can't be!" 
(Cloud summons his strength. He lifts the sword, still through his chest, 
raising Sephiroth an inch above the ground, then two inches. With all his 
might, he flings the sword to the side. It slides out of his body as 
Sephiroth flies into the wall above the Mako pool. He falls down, down, 
into the Lifestream. Cloud slumps to the ground. The screen fades to 
white.)  
   
Return To the Others 
(The  fades back in to Cloud's subconscious. Tifa and Young Cloud 
stand in the center of the great green platform.) 
Tifa: "Cloud……" 
 
"Then… this is goodbye, Tifa. Until we meet again……" 
(He stands straight. The three Clouds guarding Nibelheim, the well, and 
the window, translucent, all stand in unison.) 
Tifa: "…………!?" 
(The three Clouds turn and walk forward, forming a triangle around Young 
Cloud. One by one, each steps forward, fusing with his body with a small 
metallic sound. The camera pans up, and the writhing, transparent Cloud 
high above, floats back down to earth with a hig-pitched whine. He lands 
crumpled before Tifa. She kneels next to him.) 
Tifa: "Cloud!!" 
 
Cloud: "Uh…… Ah, Uh……!" 
 
Cloud: "Uh…… Tifa……" 
Tifa: "Oh, Cloud……! It's really you, isn't it?" 
Cloud: "Yeah…… Tifa…… We finally…… meet again……" 
 
Tifa: "You stupid jerk!! You had us all worried sick!!" 
 
Cloud: "Krgh……!" 
 
Tifa: "Cloud!? Are you all right!?" 
(We hear the cry of the planet. 
Cloud: "V, voice…… Their……"
 
Tifa: "I see. We're… in the Lifestream aren't we?" "Everyone's waiting." "Let's go back, Cloud. Back to everyone……" 
Cloud: "Yeah, I guess so… Come on, Tifa. Let's go home……" 
(He stands. The screen fades to black. When it fades in again, we see 
Cloud and Tifa float upwards through the green of the Lifestream. The 
screen fades to white.)  
   
Awakening 
(The  fades in to show the entire party at Mideel. The town has been 
demolished; loose boards float in the green Mako pool created in the 
earthquake. Tifa and Cloud lie, dazed, on the ground.)
Barret: "Yo! You awright!? Tifa!?" 
Tifa: "u… uhh……?" 
 
Tifa: "Barret… You came back, I……" "Cloud… Where is he?" 
Barret: "Don't worry about him. He's a
tough one." 
Tifa: "Barret…… I…… When I was in the Lifestream I saw the real 
Cloud." 
 
Tifa: "I mean, I didn't really find him. Cloud found himself on his 
own…" 
Barret: "Awright, I know… I shouldn't have doubted him." 
 
Barret: "But I can't win against you. You're some kinda lady." 
 
Tifa: "People have so many things pent up inside of themselves…" "And they can forget so many things……" "Strange…… isn't it…………" 
 
Barret: "Yo, Tifa! Snap outta it!!" 
 
Barret: "Tifa……!?"  

   
There Ain't No Gettin' Off 
(The  fades in. We are in the operation room on the Highwind. The 
party is seated around the table; Cloud stands at the head of it.) 
Cloud: "Everyone…… I'm sorry. I don't know what to say……" 
Red XIII: "Don't say anything, Cloud. All you've been doing is apologizing." 
 
Cloud: "I never was in SOLDIER." "I made up the stories about what happened to me five years ago, 
about being in SOLDIER." "I left my village looking for glory, but never made it in to 
SOLDIER……" "I was so ashamed of being so weak; then I heard this story from 
my friend Zack…" "And I greated an illusion of myself made up of what I had seen 
in my life….." "And I continued to play the charade as if it were true." 
 
Barret: "Illusion, huh…? Pretty damn strong for a 'lusion, I'd say." 
 
Cloud: "I'm physically built like someone on SOLDIER." "Hojo's plan to clone Sephiroth wasn't that difficult." "It was just the same procedure they use when creating members of 
SOLDIER." 
 
Cloud: "You see, someone in SOLDIER isn't simply exposed to Mako energy." "Their bodies are actually injected with Jenova cells……" "For better or for worse, only the strong can enter SOLDIER." "It has nothing to do with the Jenova Reunion." "But weak people…… like me, get lost in the whole thing." 
 
Cloud: "The combination of Jenova cells, Sephiroth's strong will, and my 
own weaknesses are what created me." "Everyone knew that. I'm…… Cloud." 
 
Cloud: "……the master of my own illusionary world." "But I can't remain trapped in an illusion any more……" "I'm going to live my life without pretending." 
Tifa: "You're sure messed up, Cloud!" 
Barret: "That means there ain't no difference from before!" 
 
Cait-Sith: "By the way, Cloud. What are you going to do now?" "Don't tell me you're going to leave the ship?" 
Cloud: "……I'm the reason why Meteor is falling towards us." 
 
Cloud: "That's why I have to do everything in my power to fight this 
thing." 
Barret: "Good!! Then you're gonna keep fightin' to save the planet!?" 
Cloud: "It's like you always told me, Barret." 
Barret: "Oh, uh, you mean that!" 
Red XIII: "What? I don't understand!" 
 
Cloud: "There ain't no gettin' offa this train we on!" 
Tifa: "There ain't no gettin' offa this train we on!" 
Barret: "The train we on don't make no stops!" 
(They all cheer and run out of the operation room. Cloud stays behind. He 
turns to face the wall behind him, sighs, and shakes his head. Then he too 
leaves. On the way out, the pilot by the door stops him.) 
"Cloud, I was deeply moved by your story!" "I'm really a weak person and so I could really understand how you 
feel, Cloud!" "No one knows when fighting will begin. But let's get ready!"
(Cloud chooses his party and leaves the
operation room, heading for the
bridge.When he arrives on the bridge of
the Highwind, the rest of the party is
assembled there.) 
Cait-Sith: "Listen, Cloud." "We're right in the middle of the mission for the Master Materia, 
right?" "I know this's kinda outta the blue, but there's a underwater 
reactor at Junon." "As fas as I can see, that's the only one left." "That's that. Let's go!" 
   
Underwater Reactor Sub Space 
People on the Highwind 
Barret: "C'mon, Cloud! Don't #&$* around!" "We're goin' to Junon, boyeee!!" 
Cait-Sith: "This's kinda on the spur of the moment, but shouldn't we oughta 
get to Junon!?" 
Red XIII: "I'm glad you're back with us!" 
Tifa: "Let's do our best, Cloud!" 
Cid: "I know how tough it is bein' a leader, because I've been one." "I always forget who has what materia." 
 
People in Junon 
"They say Shinra's gathering Huge Materia from around the world 
and bringing it to Junon." "Bringing it to Junon must mean they want to use their airplanes." "I've noticed there's been a lot of Shinra ships recently. I 
think they're going to the off-shore Underwater Reactor." "Isn't Shinra trying to transport the Reactor's Huge Materia?" 
"Once Meteor hits, not just the fish, but the whole ocean will be 
destroyed." 
"I remember years ago, seein' the Shinra build a long pipe 
underwater." "The underwater reactor is connected to Junon by a pipe." "You should be able to get to the reactor through it." 
Priscilla: "Who are you---?" 
 
Priscilla: "Cloud!!" "Stupid jerk! Look how much you made me worry!! Were you at the 
Lifestream?" 
Cloud: "Yeah, that's right." 
Priscilla: "You've gotta be more careful! Because you're going to marry me 
one day."
(Cloud heads to the north end of the city, where a Shinra guard stands 
watch over a sliding door to the elevator.) 
"If you want to get on the elevator that badly, give me 10 gil!" 
Okay, I guess: No way! 
Cloud: Okay, I guess 
 
"Hurry up and get in!" 
Cloud: No way! 
"You're such a cheapskate." 

(Cloud enters the elevator. He presses a switch there and is lifted to the 
next floor. He arrives in the heart of Military Base Junon, where he once 
dressed as a guard to greet Rufus.) 
People in the Base 
"The Shinra's collecting Huge Materia at the Junon Undersea 
Reactor!"
"When they're done, they'll bring it to this airport." "Get out of here before you get in the way!" "What… me? I'm gonna be watching from here, so that I don't get 
in the way either!" 
"After they get in, they'll take it to the airport and will 
transport it to Rocket Town by Gelnika. Don't let your guard down!" 
"They've finally started collecting the Huge Materia from the 
Junon Underwater Reactor." 
"Come on in!" "Welcome!!" "I just can't believe it. I never thought a monster like Weapon 
really existed."  
"They're not going to get me down! Not me!!" "Weapon, Meteor, even bad customers, aren't going to get me!" (
Sells items) 
"Hey!! Stay out of the way!" 
"I'm starting to feel like I can't stop anymore." "I've been had!! I want to get in a real battle, too!" 
"Hmmm? Back again, Mr. Know-it-all!?" "All right! You can enter!!" 
"This is a Respectable Inn… guests only!" "You should absorb all the wisdom until it is a part of you." 
"Ok wise-guy, I'll ask about Materia just so you can let off 
some stress." 
"Ok. Expert! Enlighten us on Limit Techniques, why doncha?" 
"Ok, Mr. Know-it-all, ex-SOLDIER! Let me revenge… I mean, 
review!" 
"I lost most of my rivals in the attack on Weapon." "Oh, of course, I was here, studying." "And the coveted green officer's uniform is almost in my reach." 
"Weapon and Meteor scared everyone else off, but I'm sittin' here 
soused as usual."
"I'd like to close down the shop, but we got the regulars to 
think about… I don't know what to do……" 
(They head to the long street in the middle of the base. Cloud stops and
shrugs.) 
Cloud: "I may be mistaken, but…… Doesn't it feel like we're missing
something?" 
(He continues further into the base, reaching an underground path where a 
red officer trains a horde of blue grunts. He turns to face Cloud.) 
"All right!! Let's see how hard you trained!" 
(The soldiers turn in perfect sync away from the officer, his back still 
turned.) 
"Attention! Charge--!!" 
 
"He… hey--!! That's the Underwater Reactor!! Come back!!" 
(He runs after them. Cloud shrugs and continues toward the reactor. He 
enters an elevator at the end of the underground path. A woman stands 
looking uninterested in one corner; two guards in the rear raise their 
guns.) 
"How 'bout, whoever stays alive, gets to take her out?" 
"All right, you're on!!" "But… What if both of us…" 
"Whoa!! Don't even talk about that!" 

(The elevator stops at the ground floor. The woman stands, waiting for her 
floor.)
"…gulp… " 
(Cloud walks past her out of the elevator. Another guard comes rushing up 
to him. A barking dog stands in the door behind him.) 
"OK! Back to work!! Back to work!!" 
 
"Yawn… I'm sleepy!!" 
"For Junon!!" 
 
(Cloud continues toward the reactor. Traversing a series of hallways and 
taking another elevator, he arrives at the ocean. He walks through a glass, 
Sea World-esque tunnel, through which he can see dolphins and schools of 
fish swim past. At the end is a small room lined with glass tubes filled 
with water. Cloud presses a switch on the wall; the door seals shut and 
the tubes empty of water. When he exits the room he is at a lower floor. 
An elevator. Cloud arrives on a narrow wire walkway; behind him we see a 
Shinra submarine docked. A mechanical arm trolleys through the huge 
warehouse, above Cloud. He continues past it, reaching another room. 
Shinra guards patrol all around. Cloud attempts to sneak by, but one guard 
catches him as he walks past.) 
"You, you're Cloud!!" 
 
 
"You are NOT getting this Huge Materia!!" 
 
 
"So you WERE after the Huge Materia!" 
 
(Cloud exits the room. He ends up on another narrow wire walkway. A huge 
metal pod stands near it. At the top is the Huge Materia.) 
Cloud: "!? The Huge Materia!" 
(They all look on as the mechanical arm finally arrives at its 
destination. It lowers, picks up the Materia, and trundles off.) 
Tifa: "They're gonna take it on that submarine!" 
Cid: "That's what you think! ^%$@#&#!" 
(They rush into the next room. The Shinra submarine is docked here. Reno 
stands here, his back turned to them.) 
Cloud: "Did we make it!?" 
(He watches as the arm slowly lowers the Huge Materia into a port on the 
sub's deck. The porthole closes it inside. Cloud runs forward, up to Reno.) 
Reno: "What are you doing? Help load." 
 
Reno: "Cloud!?" 
Cid: "You know I don't work for cheap!" 
Tifa: "Looks like we barely made it." 
Cloud: "Either give it to us or else." "…which is it gonna be?"
Reno: "Unfortunately, I don't have time to deal with you." 
 
Reno: "My priority is the Huge Materia!" 
 
 
 
Cloud: "Damn! The submarine!" 
Tifa: "We have to go after it!" 
Cid: "Hold on to your horses! Let's get it from them!!" 
(Cloud rushes across the docking bay to another submarine on the other 
side. A bevy of Shinra soldiers all dash randomly around the deck. Cloud 
wades through them.) 
"Y, you!" 
 
"You're not taking over this ship!" 
 
(Cloud climbs onto the deck of the submarine and drops down the porthole 
to the interior. Three guards stand on either side. One raises his gun.) 
"You want the Sub? Just try an' take it!" 
 
"Um… sir! Maybe we shouldn't piss them off…" 
 
(Cloud runs forward into the cockpit. A red officer stands behind the 
captain's chair; two blue guards leap up from their navigation seats. 
These are the people who helped you prepare for the President's parade. 
The officer starts shaking his head) 
"NO, NO!! This is terrible!" 
 
"We don't have much time left! I don't want to die!" 
 
"There's still so much more I've got to do!" "I never even got to do my special victory dance in battle!" 
"All right!! Then make this your first victory!!" "Go on, show 'em!!" 
 
"Yes, sir!!" 
"Remember you last training. Begin!!" 
 
"Yes, sir!!" 
 
"I'm back! An' now I got no regrets!!" 
"ATT---ACK!!" 
Cloud: "Hmmmm…" 
Fight them: Take them prisoner 
 
Cloud: Take them prisoner 
 

 
Cloud: "Someone… please. I'm sorry I can't take it anymore." "The lack of space, the shaking, the roar of the engine…" 
 
Tifa: "What are we going to do… We stole a submarine but can't pilot 
it." 
Cid: "Hunka junk… just gotta do this!" 
(He fiddles with the controls. A red light starts flashing and he jumps 
up, startled) 
Cid: "SEE! Now you take over!"
 
Cloud: "Hey, you're right. I DO feel a little better driving." "No sweat. Just leave everything to me." 
Tifa: "You can do it, Cloud!" 
Cid: "I'll be watchin' from here!" 
 
Cloud: "Well, now what?" 
Read the manual: Sit in the seat: Leave it alone 
Cloud: Read the manual 
"Submarine Operation Manual Beginner's Edition" 
 
Cloud: Sit in the seat 
 
Cloud: "Everything seems set…" 
Read the manual: Start the mission! 
Cloud: Read the manual 
 
Cloud: Start the mission! 
Cloud: "This switch…? 
 
"Main screen: ON" Change the screen mode. 
 

Cloud: Leave it alone 

(The mission begins. Cloud pilots the submarine, sinking the red target 
sub. After winning the minigame, you acquire control of the submarine.) 
Cloud: "Phew--! We did it!!" "The Huge Materia should be at the bottom of the sea by now. Let's 
continue the search…" 
 
"All Shinra Submarine Units, do you read…?" "…All Shinra Submarine Units, do you read…?" 
Cloud: "Hmm…? …Must be from Shinra." 
"…Report, No. 2…" 
Tifa: "No. 2…" "…I saw that written at the dock! They must mean this sub." 
Cloud: "All right, I'll do it." 
 
Cloud: "This is Shinra No. 2… Everything's normal." 
"…Roger…" "…Your next mission is…" "…Return to Junon Dock…" "…We will transport the Huge Materia from the airport…" "…Those without other assignments will report for guard duty…" "That is all. Over and out…" 
Cloud: "Junon Airport… We should make it if we hurry." "Forget about the Huge Materia for now." "We're climbing!" 
Cid: "The airport? No sweat!" 
 
   
Gelnika Takes Off Countdown to Dreams and Death 
(Cloud exits the submarine and enters Junon. He takes the elevator up into 
the base and heads to the airport. He arrives just in time to see the 
Gelnika take off from the runway and fly off.) 
Cloud: "Oh no! The Huge Materia…" 
Tifa: "Can't we go after it?" 
Cid: "Where's that thing headed?" 
Cloud: "Rocket Town, of course." 
 
People in Rocket Town 
"The Shinra serious 'bout launching that piece of crap rocket? 
But why now…?" 
"What's young President Rufus doing by getting all those 
mechanics together?" 
"Even with all this goin' on outside, that guy still won't come 
out of the bathroom? He must be a damn water tank!?" 
"Would you like something to drink?" 
Let me hear your story: Not interested 
Cloud: Let me hear your story 
"Seems like Palmer of Shinra, Inc. ordered soldiers to restore 
the rocket…" 
Cloud: Not interested 
"If he continues on like that, he's gonna collapse some day. 
Y'know what I mean? I'm talkin' heart attack." 

"There's a bunch of Shinra people here messin' with the rocket…" "Is my rocket… all right?" 
"Mmmmm, a SPECTACLE." 
"Is something about to happen? Oh, I'm getting excited."
(Cloud heads north, to the old rocket. Steam emanates from the engines; 
the Shinra are about to launch. Two guards standing by the stairs to the 
launch platform spot him.) 
"Those terrorists are here!" 
 
(Cloud runs up the stairs. More guards wait on the launch platform at the 
top.) 
"Don't let them get any further! Everyone, ATTACK---!" 
 
 
"Urrrgh, you're not going anywhere! Uh un, nowhere!" 
 
Cid: "Goddammit, what the hell do they think they're gonna do to my 
rocket!?" "I'm outta here, Cloud! I'm gonna kick those $^%$# Shinra right 
out of my rocket!"
(Cloud climbs the ladder to the top of the rocket. Rude, flanked by two 
guards, stands outside the rocket's door.) 
Rude: "…you again?" 
 
Rude: "…We will eliminate everyone who gets in Shinra's way." 
 

Rude: "…….they got us." 
(Cloud strolls right over Rude and enters the rocket. Another guard is 
waiting inside.) 
"You… you! Why are you here? Rude of the Turks should've been 
here!!"
 
Cloud: "Too bad. Those guys are over there." 

"Oh man… the Turks, being done in like that… But, I won't let 
you through!"
 
(The guard collapses on the floor. Cloud walks past into the rocket control 
room. Cid's mechanics all scurry about, fixing and adjusting things.) 
Cid: "Hey! What the hell're you guys doin'!?" 
 
"Hey! Just when I thought somethin' was goin' on, you came back!"
"Listen to me, Captain. We're gonna launch this rocket!"
Cid: "Huh? What are you talkin' 'bout?" 
"We're gonna load a Materia bomb in this and blow up Meteor." 
"Our rocket's gonna save the planet!" 
"Urrrrgh. Man this is so COOL!!" 
Cloud: "Wait a minute!" 
 
Cid: "Shut up!! Just shut the hell up!" 
 
Cid: "How's the rocket?" 
"It's pretty much OK." 
"But…" 
"We planned to run it into Meteor on Auto-Pilot, but the most 
important device is broken." 
Cid: "Broken? How's the repair goin'?" 
"Shera's doin' it…" 
Cid: "Oh great! What a buncha wizards you guys are! She's gonna take a 
100 years!" 
 
Cid: "I'm gonna take over, so don't worry about the Auto-Pilot!" "Hey, go ahead! Go tell everyone!" 
 
"All right, Captain. Good luck." 
 
Cloud: "Hey, Cid! What're you doing!?" 
 
Cloud: "There are generations of knowledge and wisdom inside the 
Materia." "We're gonna borrow their powers and save the planet from 
Sephiroth." "There's no way that we can lose the Huge Materia. You 
understand that, right?" 
 
Cid: "Yeah, I understand. I understand that Materia is precious, and I 
also understand what you're thinking." "But listen." "I don't give a rat's ass whether it's science or magical power." 
 
Cid: "No. I guess if I had to choose, I'd rather put my money on the 
power of science." "Humans who used to only roam around on the ground are able to 
fly now!" "And finally, we're about to go into outer space." "Science is a "Power" created and developed by humans. And 
science just might be what saves this planet." 
 
Cid: "I was able to earn my living thanks to science. So to me, 
there's nothing greater!" 
 
Cid: "Now quit your worrying 'bout what Shinra's gonna do!" "I don't want to regret not having done something later." 
 
Cloud: "But, Cid……" 
 
Cid: "Shut the hell up!! I don't wanna hear it!!" 
 
Cid: "Alright, time to get back to work! Anyone who ain't involved, 
get the hell outta here!" 
 
Cid: "What the hell……? What the hell happened?" 
 
Palmer: "Hey-hey!" 
 
Cid: "Palmer! What the hell did'ya do!?" 
Palmer: "They said they finished repairing the Auto-Pilot. So, I 
laun---ched it!" 
Cid: "Goddamn Shera! Why'd she pick today to get fast!" 
 
Cid: "DAMN! Won't even budge! It's completely locked up!" 
Palmer: "Hey-hey-hey! Almost lift off!" 
Cid: "What the!? No countdown!? It just don't seem the same without 
it!" 
Palmer: "Hey!!!! Hey-hey!!! Blast------off!" 
(FMV sequence. The rocket's engines continue to steam as the timer counts 
down from 5. 4. 3. 2. 1. The engines starts spinning and burning, emitting 
a blast of air that sends trees, tires, everything that is not tied down 
blowing out of the city. The engines spin faster and faster until they 
create enough lift to send the rocket into space, leaving a trail of 
exhaust.)  
   
Crash Course Shinra No. 26's Huge Materia 
 
Cid: "I finally made it… outer space…" 
 
Cid: "Let's see, how's the course set…?"
(He punches some buttons and taps his foot as a depiction of the rocket's 
course appears on the monitor. A dotted line travels from the green circle 
of the planet to the red circle of Meteor.) 
Cid: "Yup, it's headed for a collision course with Meteor." 
Tifa: "Can't we do something? If it goes on, we're……" 
(Cid presses more buttons. A red message appears on the screen. He kicks 
the panel.) 
Cid: "That Palmer went outta his way to lock the Auto-Pilot device. 
We might not be able to change the course." 
Cloud: "…this is the end?" 
 
Cid: "Huh? What the hell're you sayin'? You're still young, and you 
give up that easily?" 
 
Cid: "I'm not gonna crash into Meteor." 
 
Cid: "Just watch." 
 
Cid: "I keep an Escape Pod on the rocket just for emergencies like 
this." 
 
Cid: "I deciphered the lock code on the Escape Pod. We'll bail right 
before we crash into Meteor." 
 
Tifa: "Hey, what about the Huge Materia?" 
Cid: "……" 
 
Cid: "If you want the Materia, do whatever you want!" "The Materia should be there after you climb that ladder." 
Cloud: "…You sure?" 
 
Cid: "I dunno…" "I know what I said a minute ago." 
 
Cid: "But maybe all that I really wanted was just to go into outer 
space." 
 
Cid: "So, why don't you all do whatever you think is right?"
(They climb the ladder to a room at the tip of the rocket. The Huge 
Materia is sitting in a glass case in the center.) 
Cloud: "I finally found the Huge Materia…"
 
Cid: "It's structured so that the lock can be opened if we enter the 
passcode from this control panel." 
 
Enter Passcode 
Cid: "Hey, Cloud, you know how to use it, right?" "Everytime it says, 'Enter Passcode,' push one of those Circle, 
X, Triangle, Square buttons." "If you punch in the right code, it'll unlock and you can get 
the Huge Materia!" 
 
Cloud: "So, what order am I supposed to enter the passcode in?" 
 
Cid: "I dunno. Just try and punch in the code randomly." 
 
Passcode Error: Unauthorized User Identified: Protection System will activate in 3 minutes 
Cid: "Seems like you missed the code!" "If we don't enter the correct passcode before the Protection 
System activates, we won't be able to get the Materia back!" 
(Cloud, with some marginally helpful clues from Cid, manages to enter the 
correct passcode Square, Circle, X, X.) 
Passcode Confirmed: Identified as an Authorized User: Unlocked 
 
Cid: "Alright, Cloud!! It's unlocked!" 
 
Cid: "Yup, my great advice saved the day." 
 
   
Wreckage 
(Cloud, Huge Materia in hand, comes down the ladder, through the cockpit, 
and down to the oxygen-tank room. As he passes, one of the oxygen tanks 
sparks, then explodes. The screen goes white, then we see Shera, in some 
other room in the rocket, working on some repairs. She hears the explosion 
and rushes out. The  fades back to the oxygen tank room. Cloud and 
Tifa are ducking and covering their heads. The tank that exploded is 
emitting dense smoke. A huge chunk of metal from it is now on the floor. 
Cid's leg is pinned under it.)
Cid: "Grrrgh!" "Damn! My leg's stuck in the debris……" 
 
Cloud: "Cid!!" 
 
Tifa: "…I can't! It's so heavy, I can't lift it…" 
Cid: "Don't worry 'bout me. Hurry up and go! If you don't hurry, the 
rocket's gonna crash into Meteor!" 
 
Cloud: "…I can't go without my friends." 
 
Cid: "You ^%#@&%……! No time to worry 'bout other people!" 
 
Cloud: "I'm gonna do whatever I can." 
 
Cid: "You're stupid. You're really $#&^%$* stupid." 
 
Cid: "Tank Number 8 blew up…… So Tank Number 8… really was 
malfunctioning……" 
 
Cid: "Shera… You were right." 
 
Cid: "But, ……this is the end for me." 
 
Shera: "Don't say that, Cid." 
 
Cid: "Huh!? Shera!?" 
Shera: "I tagged along. I'm coming to help you." 
 
Cid: "You stupid &$#&%*%&%#!!" 
 
Cid: "……Sorry." 
  




   
Escape Pod Too Little, Too Late 
(The  fades in to the room where Shera had been making repairs. A 
circular portal slides open and Shera and Cloud come through it.) 
Shera: "The Escape Pod is this way. Please hurry." 
(They all continue to the escape pod. Shera turns to them, waiting for 
them to enter.) 
Shera: "Hurry. I'm going to detach the Escape Pod." 

Cid: "Hey, Shera! Does this Pod really fly?" 
Shera: "It'll be OK. I've been checking it till now." 
 
Cid: "……Then I'm relieved." 
 
Shera: "……Thanks." 
:    

(FMV sequence. The outer shell of the rocket tears away in one spot and 
the escape pod tumbles out. One piece of the rocket still attached falls 
away, leaving the pod, a sphere, floating back towards the planet. The 
 fades to the interior of the pod. Cid is peering out of the viewport 
with wonder.) 
Cid: "So this is… outer space…" "Man… it's the real thing… I'm really here in outer space…" 
(He looks back in the direction of the rocket as the blue curve of the 
planet's surface comes into view.) 
Cid: "So long, Shinra No. 26…" 
(FMV sequence. The escape pod hurtles back to the planet, a small flame 
forming around it as it re-enters the atmosphere. The camera switches to 
show the rocket heading straight for Meteor. It shrinks to a pinpoint as 
it plummets toward the surface of Meteor. They collide in space with a 
blinding flash of light. The  fades to the exterior of the Shinra 
building. The light from the explosion lights the area up like fire; the 
people standing in the road all duck in fear. The  changes to Cosmo 
Canyon, also bathed in the blinding light. The  moves to show 
Bugenhagen, floating next to his model of the planet. The tiny replica of 
Meteor hovering above it also explodes in a light just as bright as that 
outdoors. Bugenhagen throws his arm over his eyes until the light fades. 
The  moves back to the exterior of Shinra Building. The people slowly 
stand up as the light fades. One person frantically points at the sky. The 
camera pans up to show Meteor. FMV sequence. The camera moves along the 
surface of Meteor. Huge fragments of the rock orbit above the surface of 
Meteor, creating electrical sparks along the dry stone. Some of them crash 
into one another in huge explosions. The rocket crashed into Meteor, 
causing great damage to one side of it, but it was not enough. Meteor 
still hangs in the sky. The  fades back to Cosmo Canyon. The entire 
village is silent and still, save the windmills which still turn 
expectantly. The  changes back to Bugenhagen's lab. He floats next to 
the model of the planet, shaking his head sadly as the tiny Meteor still 
hovers above it. The  changes again to the exterior of the Shinra 
building. The people in the street begin to realize what has happened. One 
young girl begins to cry; others just shake their heads; one falls to his 
knees in the street, futilely beating his fist on the asphalt in anger and 
frustration.)  
   
The Cry Of the Planet That Someone is Us 
(The  fades in. The entire party is on the bridge of the Highwind; 
Barret, Cloud and Tifa stare out the window at the clouds passing by below; 
Cid and Cait-Sith face their backs; Red XIII looks in another direction, 
distant.) 
Cloud: Rufus and the others plan was a failure…" 
(Cloud walks closer to the window, watching the clouds, shaking his head. 
Barret turns to him.) 
Barret: "What a bust… But I kinda hoped it'd work." 
 
Cait-Sith: "We been botherin' them as much as we can…" "But there ain't no other way… Wonder if we've been wrong all 
this time?" 
 
Red XIII: "Makes you worry, doesn't it?" 
 
Tifa: "Don't worry! Think!" 
 
Cid: "Hey! The girl's right." "You start worryin' and there's no stoppin' it! Things just start 
fallin' apart and get worse and worse." 
 
Barret: "You're pretty damn optimistic! You up to somethin'?" 
 
Cid: "Yeah, I been thinkin' about this and that." "All the time we been up here lookin' at the planet." "I been thinkin' even when we were floatin' in the ocean in that 
escape pod." 
 
Cloud: "I've been thinking too. About the universe… planet… ocean." "How wide and big… No matter where I go and what I do it won't 
change a thing." 
 
Cid: "Maybe you're right." 
 
Cid: "But I came up with something different." 
(He turns to face Cait-Sith and Red XIII. Cloud, Barret, and Tifa gather 
around him.) 
Cid: "I always thought this planet was so huge." "But lookin' at it from space, I realized it's so small." 
 
Cid: "We're just floatin' in the dark. ……kind of makes you feel 
powerless." "On top of that it's got Sephiroth festerin' inside it like a 
sickness." 
 
Cid: "That's why I say this planet's still a kid." "A little kid sick and trembling in the middle of this huge 
universe." 
 
Cid: "Someone's gotta protect it." 
(He turns to Cloud and Tifa and cocks his head to one side, tapping his 
foot.) 
Cid: "Ya follow me? That someone is us." 
 
Tifa: "Cid… that's beautiful." 
Barret: "Yo! Cid! You even got to me!" "So, now what? How're we gonna protect the planet from Meteor?" 
(Cid turns to face Cait-Sith, then Red XIII, then Tifa. He scratches his 
head. He sits down on the floor, leaning against a control panel.) 
Cid: "………………I'm still thinkin' about that." 
 
Red XIII: "Huh!?" 
(He comes bounding back up the steps to the others. They all turn to face 
him.) 
Red XIII: "Did you…… hear something?" 
 
Tifa: "The planet's scream…… or Meteor…? Is it this planet?" 
 
Cloud: "Hey, how do we know that this is really the planet's scream?" 
Tifa: "Did you forget?" "Bugenhagen told us." 
 
Cloud: "Bugenhagen…" 
Red XIII: "Let's go see Grandfather! To Cosmo Canyon!" "I'm sure he'll be able to tell us something that will be helpful!" 
   
Remembrance 
People on the Highwind 
Cait-Sith: "This's just between you 'n' me but…" "That there Bugenhagen feller, used to be a pretty handy Shinra 
worker." "Yep, he ain't never bought no weapons or Mako though……" 
Barret: "That Bugenhagen guy… He was a weird old dude." "I though he was some kinda naturalist, but he was all into them 
machines." 
Tifa: "Did Bugenhagen…… tell you anything?" 
Cid: "Maybe it's just me, but has this ship been remodeled without me 
knowin' it?" "All these switches and levers. They're kinda gettin' to me." 
Red XIII: "Hurry, hurry! We must go meet Grandfather!" 
(Cloud pilots the Highwind to Cosmo Canyon. He meets the doorman at the 
gate.) 
"Oh, it's you. This is terrible. The color of that unlucky star…" "The children are all so scared that they won't even go outside." "I'd rather not see it either…" 
(Cloud heads up to Bugenhagen's observatory. Bugenhagen is waiting for 
them there.) 
Bugenhagen: "Ho Ho Hoooo. If you are ever in need of my wisdom, you are 
always welcome here." 
Cloud: "Yeah, that's why we came." 
 
Bugenhagen: "What to do? Have you lost your way? When that happens we each 
have to take a good long look at ourselves." "There's always something in the deepest reaches of our hearts." "Something buried, or something forgotten." "Remember it… Whatever that is, must certainly be what you are 
all looking for…" 
Cloud: "That's easy enough to say… But, I can't remember a thing." 
Bugenhagen: "It must be there. Look harder!" 
Tifa: "…no good. Cloud, let's have the others come." 
 
Bugenhagen: "Do you see it? What is it that you are searching for?" 
(The  fades back in; we are at Bugenhagen's observatory, now, the 
entire party is present. Cloud and Tifa stand on either side of 
Bugenhagen; Barret stands in the back; Cait-Sith stands behind Cloud, 
Red XIII is in one corner, and Cid is leaned casually against a wall, 
smoking a cigarette.) 
Cait-Sith: "Nope. Not a thing. Naw. Can't come up with a thing." 
 
Cloud: "I remember Aerith a lot." "No… not that. You haven't remembered. You haven't forgotten. 
That's not it…" "How would you say it… Aerith was right there all along. Right 
by our side." "She was so close, we couldn't see her. What Aerith did… The 
words she left behind…" 
Tifa: "That reminds me… I was the same." 
Red XIII: "As was I." 
Barret: "Me too…" 
Cloud: "She said that she was the only one who could stop Sephiroth's 
Meteor." 
Tifa: "But Aerith is gone." 
Red XIII: "Is it impossible for us to carry on… what Aerith tried to 
accomplish?" 
Barret: "We ain't no Ancients, if that's what ya mean." 
 
Cid: "What, did that girl go off to that place?" 
Cloud: "That's it!!" 
Cid: "What's it?" 
Cloud: "We don't know about it." "What did Aerith know?" "Why did she face Sephiroth without running away?" 
Red XIII: "I see… She returned there once again, correct?" 
Bugenhagen: "Hmmm. Perhaps I'll have you take me there." 
Red XIII: "You're going too?" 
Bugenhagen: "What's so surprising about that…?" "Even I want to get out from time to time and see the outside 
world. I wonder what did it? I haven't felt like this in ages." 
 
Red XIII: "It must be the planet. The planet is calling you!" 
Cid: "Yeah, hoo boy, the planet calling… right." 
 
Bugenhagen: "Ho Ho Hoooo. Then let's go." 
 
Cloud: "Oh yeah, Bugenhagen. I have one more thing I want to ask you." "We're carrying around Huge Materia. This is pretty delicate 
stuff and we would like to keep it in a safe place…" 
Bugenhagen: "Ho Ho Hoooo. Then we'll put it upstairs. Now, shall we be on our 
way?" 
(Cloud steps onto the elevator. Bugenhagen moves over to a switch on the 
wall.) 
Bugenhagen: "I'll teach you how to work the machine. Watch carefully now. You 
just pull this here…"
(The elevator lifts them up to the solar-system model. The Huge Materia 
is now floating in space.) 
Bugenhagen: "Ho Ho Hoooo. Is this what you call Huge Materia…?" "This is really rare Materia, indeed." "Materia this rare is certain to have a special consciousness 
enclosed in it." 
 
Bugenhagen: "Ho Ho Hoooo. Good. Now let's leave." "Do you remember how to use the machine down below? If you ever 
want to see Materia, come here anytime." 
  
   
Knowledge Of the Ancients 
(The  fades in. We are in the main room of the Highwind; Bugenhagen 
is floating outisde the Operation room.) 
Bugenhagen: "Hm, hmm, hmm!……" "Smells like machinery." "I love this smell." "Of course, I also love the smell of nature, too……" "Hm? Is the deck up there?" "Then I'll be on the deck just passing the time." "I can feel the workings of the planet in the smell of the wind." "I also feel the greatness of man's wisdom and the knowledge in 
the smell of machinery…" "Well, bye for now." 
 
People on the Highwind 
Cait-Sith: "I went an' told Aerith's Mom about her death." "Yes, an' Miss Elmyra was cryin' herself silly… So was little 
Marlene…" 
Barret: "And Aerith… she's dead." "Guess she turned into spiritual energy and returned to the 
planet, huh?" "But even if she did, there's no way we'll meet her again…" 
Tifa: "I wonder what Aerith felt… when she was on that altar…?" 
Cloud: "I'm sure she wanted to give her life for the planet…" 
Tifa: "Really? I wonder? I don't think that's it at all." "I think she didn't think she would die at all, but that she 
planned on coming back all along." "She always used to talk about the 'Next time'." "She talked about the future more that any of us…" 
Cid: "Aerith…?" "I wanted to give her a ride in the Highwind……" 
Red XIII: "Aerith used to pat me on the nose sometimes." "I used to hate being treated like a child like that, but I also 
liked the attention." "I wanted to apologize to her for what I did when we first met." 
(Cloud pilots the Highwind to the City of the Ancients. He takes the same 
path he took when he first arrived on his search for Aerith, heading west, 
then north, to the small shrine in a huge cavern. The shrine is a clear 
blue, beautiful, pure, crystalline.)
Bugenhagen: "This is…" 
 
Bugenhagen: "Yes…… exactly…" 
Cloud: "Are you getting something?" 
(He floats closer to the shrine, inspecting
it.) 
Bugenhagen: "…Give me a moment."
(Cloud must run around the perimeter of the cavern to reach the shrine. 
When he arrives, Bugenhagen is floating next to it.)
Bugenhagen: "The knowledge of the Ancients swirling around here is telling me 
one thing." 
 
Bugenhagen: "The planet's in a crisis…" 
 
Bugenhagen: "A crisis beyond human power or endless time." "It says, when the time comes, we must search for 'Holy'." 
Cloud: "Holy?" 
Bugenhagen: "Holy… the ultimate White Magic. Magic that might stand against 
Meteor. Perhaps our last hope to save the planet from Meteor." "If a soul seeking Holy reaches the planet, it will appear." 
 
Bugenhagen: "Ho Ho Hoooo." "Meteor, Weapon, everything will disappear." 
 
Bugenhagen: "Perhaps, even ourselves." 
Cloud: "Even us!?" 
Bugenhagen: "It is up to the planet to decide." 
 
Bugenhagen: "What is best for the planet. What is bad for the planet." "All that is bad will disappear. That is all." 
 
Bugenhagen: "Ho Ho Hooo." "I wonder which we humans are?" 
 
Cloud: "Search for Holy… How do we do it?" 
 
Bugenhagen: "Speak to the planet." "Get the White Materia… This will bond the Planet to humans." 
 
Bugenhagen: "Then speak to the planet." "If our wish reaches the planet, the White Materia will begin to 
glow a pale green." 
 
Cloud: "…This is the end." 
 
Cloud: "Aerith had the White Materia…" "But when Aerith died, it fell from the altar…" 
 
Cloud: "That's why…… this is the end." 
 
Bugenhagen: "Ho Ho Hooo!" 
(He bounces again as he floats back down to the party. He stops in front 
of the altar.) 
Bugenhagen: "Ho Ho Hooo!" "Ho Ho Hooo!" 
 
Bugenhagen: "Look at this!" 
Cloud: "!?" 
(The camera moves in closer to the altar. Cloud turns to look as 
Bugenhagen floats closer.) 
Bugenhagen: "Ancients' writing." 
Cloud: "Can you read it?" 
 
Bugenhagen: "I can't even make it out!!" 
Cloud: "This's no time for jokes…" 
 
Bugenhagen: "I'm not an Ancient. I can't read this thing!" 
 
Bugenhagen: "I may be old, but my eyes aren't completely bad yet. Look closely 
below the writing." 
 
Cloud: "There's something written in chalk… ……(even sunlight can't 
reach) …… " 
Bugenhagen: "It was probably written by a scientist who's been here… He 
probably used all his energy to make out these two words." 
 
Cloud: "Key……? To what?" 
Bugenhagen: "I don't know… But, it probably has something to do with our 
riddle." "The riddle… then it must have something to do with Aerith." 
Cloud: "So this note points to where the key is?"
 
Bugenhagen: "Probably…" "Use these words as clues and go find the key." "I'll continue to figure out the Ancient's writing." 
 
Cloud: "A place  is, 
right?" 
 
Bugenhagen: "When you find the key, or when you can't go any further, come 
back here." "Maybe I'll understand more from the writing and get some new 
information for you." 
  
   
Green Junon Cannon Relocated 
(Cloud takes the sub by Junon in search of the key. While he's down there, 
he finds the red leader sub he sank before.) 
Cloud: "So this is the Leader Sub…" "Damn…… makes me sick just thinking about it…" 
 
"…Huge Materia recovered…" "…no damage appears to have been sustained…" 
Cloud: "…Phew… That's good to hear."
(Cloud continues searching until he finds the "Key" hiding in a small 
crevice.) 
Cloud: "Do you think it's……?" 
"…analysis completed…" "…exact date of origin cannot be determined…" "…estimated to be several thousand years old…" 
Cloud: "Key of the Ancients…" 
(Cloud gets the Key. He returns to the City of the Ancients. He heads to 
the small shrine where Bugenhagen is waiting.) 
Bugenhagen: "Oh! You've found it!" "That Music Box over there. We'll put the key in it." 
(The camera pans over to show the stone music box as Bugenhagen floats 
over to it. It is made of many blue crystals.) 
Bugenhagen: "I'll go use the key. You all wait here." "And watch closely what happens."
(The camera moves to show Bugenhagen as he places the Key into the music 
box. He bounces happily.) 
Bugenhagen: "Ho Ho Hooo!" 
(He tosses the key the rest of the way in. FMV sequence. As he does so, 
the crystals vibrate as the stone pillar in front of it recedes into the 
ground. The camera pans up; high above the shrine, a wave of water pours 
over a cliff over the cavern, creating a curtain of water around the 
shrine. Bugenhagen floats back over to Cloud, who is watching with awe.)
Bugenhagen: "Now, go inside. Hope may be inside… Or……" 
(Cloud enters the curtain of water. Bugenhagen floats by the shrine as 
the water pours around them.) 
Bugenhagen: "This was just a screen to project an image!" "Look! Look at the image projected on the screen of the water!" 
(FMV sequence. The camera floats past Cloud to show what he sees: Aerith. 
Her image is projected perfectly onto the moving pane of water, causing 
her to distort as if in a dream. We see her kneeling in prayer in the 
altar. She looks up, a smile on her face; then we see her body fall forward 
on Sephiroth's sword. We watch the materia fall from her hair as she falls, 
bouncing once on the floor, then twice. It falls with a small splash into 
the water. We now can see what happened to it after it fell. It is sitting 
peacefully at the bottom of the pool, nestled in the sand. It is glowing a 
pale green.) 
Cloud: "…It's glowing." 
Bugenhagen: "Ho Ho Hooo!! It's pale green!!" 
 
Cloud: "…Aerith. Aerith has already prayed for Holy." "…After I gave the Black Materia to Sephiroth…… Aerith's 
words came into my dreams…" "She said, she was the only one who could stop Sephiroth…… 
And to do that, there was a secret here…" "That was Holy…… That's why, she had the White Materia. 
Aerith knew about here… and what she had to do." "Aerith has left us great hope. But, it cost her her life… her 
future…" "I'm sorry… Aerith. I should have figured this out sooner." "…You left us without saying a word…… It was all so sudden, 
so I couldn't think…" "That's why it took so long for me to find out… But, Aerith… 
I understand now." "Aerith… I'll do the rest." 
Tifa: "You mean, WE…" 
 
Cid: "The big gift the flower girl left for us… It'd be sad if we 
didn't finish it!" 
(Cloud turns to Cid. He nods. He turns to face both of them and raises his 
arms.) 
Cloud: "Thank you… Aerith." "Aerith's voice has already reached the Planet. Just look at the 
glow of the White Materia." "But…… how about Holy? How come Holy isn't moving?" 
 
Cloud: "Why?" 
Bugenhagen: "Something's getting in its way." 
Cloud: "……Him……" "He's the only one that could do it." "…Sephiroth. Where are you?" 
(He leaves the shrine. On the way out of the City, the PHS rings. It's 
Cait-Sith.) 
Cloud: "What the?" 
Cait-Sith: "whisper… whisper… ." 
Cloud: "What happened?" 
Cait-Sith: "You remember when the Junon Cannon disappeared? Actually, Rufus 
moved it." 
Cloud: "Moved it? That big thing……? Where…? Why?" 
Cait-Sith: "Rufus wants to destroy Sephiroth with it." "That cannon operates on Huge Materia. But the Huge Materia has 
already been used in the Rocket Plan." "So since the cannon's useless right now, he decided to move it." "To a place where Materia… no, where Mako is gathered…" 
Cloud: "And, where is that!?" 
(FMV sequence. The camera shows Meteor hanging in the dark sky, not going 
anywhere. Then a chopper hovers up, obscuring Meteor, then a second and a 
third. They fly off, toward Midgar. The camera moves along Midgar, showing 
the framework, the fuel souces, the barrel, and finally the tip of Junon 
Cannon, appended to the top of the Shinra building. The  fades to black.)  
   
Sister Ray 
(Reeve, Heidegger and Scarlet stand around Rufus, behind his desk at 
Shinra headquarters.) 
Rufus: "……That's why, Reeve. It's your job to adjust the reactor's 
output." 
 
Reeve: "I see……" 
 
Scarlet: "Hah, hah, hah! Don't worry about adjusting it, Reeve." 
 
Scarlet: "Once you open it up all the way everything will go full speed!" 
Heidegger: "Gya hah, hah, hah! The President's sure done it this time!" "If we can only defeat Sephiroth, the idea that Meteor will also 
disappear is based on different objectives!" 
 
Scarlet: "Please remember, Mr. President…" "It was my idea to fire Mako reactor powered shells." 
 
Rufus: "Will the shells really reach the far northern border?" 
Scarlet: "Ah, hah hah!" "Of course!" 
 
Scarlet: "But Mr. President, please do not call it a Mako cannon." "This new weapon will be called……" 
 
Scarlet: "The Sister Ray!" 
  
   
Weapon Surfaces Value Of a Life Epic Battle 
(Cloud hangs up the PHS and leaves the City of the Ancients. Outside, he 
prepares to board the Highwind, then stops and looks around.) 
Cloud: "…………?" 
 
Cloud: "Wh, what the…!?" 
(The camera moves to just above Midgar. It zooms past, flying by to the 
northern continent. Just off the coast, the water begins to ripple, then 
wave, then splash hugely. The Weapon rises from the sea. It begins to 
slowly plod toward Midgar. The  fades to the bridge of the Highwind; 
everyone is gathered there. A red alarm light is flashing.)
Cid: "What's wrong?" 
 
"It's a strange signal!" 
 
Cid: "From where?" 
 
"It's coming from this… person "
(Cait-Sith raises his paws in the air as the pilot turns back to the 
controls) 
Cait-Sith: "Wow!" 
 
Cait-Sith: "Hey!" 
(He does a wild dance as the light continues to flash. He eventually 
stops.) 
Cait-Sith: "That was a surprise, the controls went crazy." "This ain't good…" "Weapon came out of the sea and is heading straight for Midgar." 
Cloud: "The new weapon should stop him, right?" 
Cait-Sith: "I don't know if it's ready or not…" 
 
Barret: "Hey! What's gonna happen to Marlene!?" 
Cait-Sith: "Doncha worry none, Marlene's in a safe place. She's with 
Aerith's mama." 
 
Cait-Sith: "Barret!!" 
 
Cait-Sith: "What was that scratching just now!?" "As long as Marlene is safe, who cares what else happens, right?" 
 
Cait-Sith: "I been itchin' to say this to ya fer a while now!" 
 
Cait-Sith: "When ya blew the Midgar No. 1 up, how many folks d'ya think 
died?" 
Barret: "…that was for the life of the planet. Ya gotta expect a few 
casualties." 
 
Cait-Sith: "A few? Whaddya mean 'a few'? What may be a few to y'all is 
everything to them who died……" 
(A pause. He turns back to face Barret, who is still staring out the 
window.) 
Cait-Sith: "Protect the planet. Hah! Y'all sure sound good!" "Ain't no one that'd go against ya. So ya think ya can do 
whatever y'all want?" 
 
Barret: "I don't wanna hear that from no one in Shinra…" 
 
Cait-Sith: "……nuthin' I can do 'bout that…" 
 
Cloud: "Stop it!" 
Tifa: "Cait-Sith…… Barret, he knows what he did." "What we did in Midgar can't be forgotten no matter what the 
reason." 
 
Tifa: "Right? We haven't forgotten, right?" 
 
Tifa: "I know you." "You can't quit the company because you're worried about the 
people in Midgar, right?" 
 
Tifa: "……Cloud?" 
 
Cloud: "OK! Let's go! We'll beat Weapon ourselves!" 
 
Cid: "Hey Cloud……" "You think we can win against that monster? We got a chance of 
winnin', right?" 
Cloud: "How would I know?" "But that's no reason for us to just let him go!" "We're goin' to Midgar and fight Weapon! Come on, let's move!" 
(The Highwind takes off. Cloud pilots it, landing outside of Midgar. The 
Weapon continues to lumber slowly towards the city. At last it reaches the 
city; it releases a guttural roar. Cloud attacks it and the battle begins.) 
 
(FMV sequence. The Weapon turns and slowly moves back toward the sea. 
Cloud and the others stay behind; as it leaves, the huge shadow it casts 
recedes from where the party stands. They watch it go.)
Tifa: "What's wrong? Are you still looking for something…?" 
 
Cloud: "No, it's…… feeling something. ……Yeah, it senses murder." 
 
Cid: "To my ship!" 
(They all run to the Highwind as the Weapon reaches the edge of the water. 
As Cloud turns to go, the PHS rings again. It's Cait-Sith.) 
Cait-Sith: "Oh no! Let's hurry out of here!" "Something big… I'm talkin' REALLY BIG's comin'!" 
  
   
Fire Weapon Falls Paths Opened President's Redemption -
(The  fades in to President Rufus' office. Rufus stands, looking out 
the window at the sea as Heidegger comes over the intercom.) 
Heidegger: "Hah, hah, hah, Mr. President, preparations for Sister Ray are 
now in order." 
 
Scarlet: "Hah, hah, hah!" "Anytime is fine." 
 
Rufus: "……Fire." 
(FMV sequence. The camera pans along the length of the Sister Ray. It looks 
ominous as it shines metallically in the night. The camera circles Midgar 
as the Mako reactors activate, one by one. When all are burning, pure Mako 
energy begins to emanate from each one through small holes in the metal 
walls. The cumulative energy of the reactors combines, flowing into the 
receptacles of the Sister Ray. The energy builds. The cannon begins to 
vibrate as a blue halo of light forms around the barrel; the molecular 
energy of the very air being drawn into the cannon as it prepares to fire. 
The halo of light is then too drawn into the barrel, and all the Mako 
energy, molecular energy, light, everything is compressed into a single 
pinpoint of light. The light from the surrounding area is as well drawn 
into the cannon and the countryside goes pitch-black. It fires. A colossal 
helix of energy launches from the cannon; the supporting structures 
collapse and every window in Shinra building shatters outwards from the 
sheer force of the fire. The  changes to Rufus' office. He 
nonchalantly flips a lock of hair from his forehead. The  changes 
into another FMV sequence; the Weapon, now across the ocean, turns. It 
lifts the armor plates on its body, revealing countless orifices from 
which bullets of energy begin to shoot across the ocean in the direction 
of the Sister Ray. The  changes to the deck of the Highwind. Everyone 
is gathered there.) 
Tifa: "Which direction is it going to attack from?" 
Red XIII: "Midgar!" 
(They all run to the railing and look out at Midgar. All except Cait-Sith. 
He stands facing the rudder, away from the group.) 
Barret: "Marlene!!" 
(FMV sequence. The Highwind circles as the fire of both the Weapon and the 
Sister Ray intermingle with each other, mixing. The white energy burst of 
the cannon strikes the Weapon square in the chest. It flies backwards as 
the entire length of the fire slips through its body. Once it is past, 
the camera moves so that we can see the inside of the Weapon's body, 
plainly shown, torn open. It sparkles with violet energy. The Weapon hits 
the ground, bounces once, then comes to a stop, dead. The  changes 
back to the Highwind.) 
Barret: "Damn…" 
Red XIII: "It went right through Weapon………" 
 
Cloud: "I see! They're after Sephiroth! The crater on the Northern 
boundary!" 
(FMV sequence. The energy blast from the Sister Ray shoots along the 
northern mountains, towards the crater. The camera follows it along, 
moving to show the inside of the blast as it speeds toward its target. It 
hits it mark. The blast slams into the energy barrier around the northern 
crater, spraying outward as if it were water from a garden hose striking a 
tree stump. The energy barrier dissipates. The  fades in to Rufus' 
office. Rufus still stands, not moving, staring out the window. The 
operator comes on the intercom.) 
 "Sir! Weapon's been defeated!!" "The barrier has disappeared!" 
(He moves for the first time and walks over to his desk. He stops and 
looks up at the ceiling as the operator speaks again.) 
"Sir! A mass of high-density energy is heading towards Midgar!" 
(FMV sequence. The energy bullets from Weapon sail over Midgar. People 
run panicking in the streets.) 
"Weapon's attacking!" "Run for your lives!" 
(The bullets continue to sail past, striking the city in several places. 
The  moves to show Rufus in his office. He stands motionless before 
his desk, watching calmly as the yellow bursts fly past his office. The 
camera makes a close-up on his eyes. He blinks once. Then a blast strikes 
his office. He doubles over, silhouetted against the flame for a moment, 
before his entire office is consumed. The  fades to black.)  
   
Imminent Explosion Hojo Schemes Midgar Bound 
(The  fades in. Cloud and the others are on the bridge of the 
Highwind.) 
Cloud: "What happened to…… Sephiroth?" 
 
Cloud: "Northern Cave…" "Let's go see what happened to it." 
(Cloud pilots the Highwind over the Northern Continent. He looks out at 
the Northern Crater.) 
Cloud: "Sephiroth's energy barrier is gone……" 
 
Cloud: "Cid! Can the airship get inside?" 
Cid: "Huh? He's my student, ain't he!? Of course he can go anywhere!" 
Cloud: "Right, sorry about that." 
 
Barret: "Yo, Cait-Sith! Now what?" 
 
Cait-Sith: "Hold it!" 
 
Cait-Sith: "Scarlet! Heidegger! What's going on?"
(The  fades in to the board room in the Shinra building. Heidegger 
has a phone pressed to his ear. Reeve and Scarlet look on. After a moment, 
he puts the phone down.) 
Heidegger: "Strange. I can't reach the President." 
Reeve: "Not the President. To Sister Ray!"
Scarlet: "Ha, ha, ha. What is it Reeve? You're speaking strangely." 
 
Reeve: "None of that matters!" "The reactor's output is increasing all by itself!" 
Scarlet: "Ww, wait a minute. That's not wise!" "It must be cool for 3 hours or it won't work. Reeve, shut off 
the machine!" 
 
Reeve: "We can't do that! It's inoperable!" 
 
"Someone has switched the machine over to mainframe operation!" "We can't operate it from here." 
Reeve: "What about the mainframe? Who!?" 
 
Reeve: "Hey, call the mainframe!" 
(Heidegger picks up the phone for a moment, then puts it down and looks at 
Reeve.) 
Heidegger: "Huh? Why are you giving orders?" 
Reeve: "I don't give a damn about the details!!" 
(He turns away and listens into his phone again. The  fades to a 
small lab at the top of Shinra building. It is exposed to the open air; 
electric sparks jump along the metal walkway. Hojo is pressing buttons at 
a large control panel.)
Hojo: "Ha, ha, ha…… Just you wait, Sephiroth." "I'll give you all the Mako you want." 
 
Reeve: "Hojo, STOP! The cannon, no, Midgar itself is in danger!" 
Hojo: "Ha, ha, ha…… One or two Midgars? …It's a small price to 
pay." 
Reeve: "Hojo! HOJO……!!" 
(Hojo doesn't answer. He continues to press buttons and pull levers for a 
few more moments.) 
Hojo: "Show me…… Sephiroth." "It should be near…" "Ha, ha, ha…… Go beyond the powers of science…" "Before your presence, science is powerless…" "I hate it, but I'll concede to it." "Just… let me see it." "Ha, ha, ha……" 
(The  fades back to the bridge of the Highwind. Barret shakes his 
arms at Cait-Sith) 
Barret: "YO! Do somethin'! Ya big cat!" 
 
Cait-Sith: "We're sunk. Hojo's doing this on his own……" "…? …? H, huh!?" 
 
Cait-Sith: "I don't like this……" 
 
Barret: "You're busted, Reeve!" 
 
Barret: "Too late tryin' to hide it now…" 
Cloud: "Can't you stop the Mako reactor?" 
 
Cait-Sith: "……We can't stop it." 
Barret: "You're from Shinra, ain't ya? So why's it impossible!?" 
Cait-Sith: "…………" 
Cid: "We came a long way to get here. You better not double-cross us 
now!" 
Cait-Sith: "I can't make you trust me……" 
Cid: "You damn fool! Don't you understand anything I'm saying?" "I don't give a damn about Shinra. If you're a man… no, if 
you're a human being, you'll save the planet! Don't you even care?" 
Cait-Sith: "No way! If we shut down the reactor, all hell will break loose!!" 
Cid: "Why? Can't you just shut off the valve?" 
Cait-Sith: "Yeah, it's easy to shut off the reactor's pipe valves……" "But the reactor made a path for the energy to escape from below." "Once you open that, it'll be impossible to close it until 
everything blasts out…" "And we can't try to stop the energy from gushing out…….." 
Barret: "An explosion!!" 
Cait-Sith: "This blast'll be way stronger than when the number 1 reactor 
blew up!" 
 
Barret: "Damn…!" 
Cait-Sith: "Forget about that……… the CANNON! We've got to get to 
Midgar! That's the first thing!!" 
Cloud: "Must stop Hojo… first." 
(The  fades back to the Shinra board room. Reeve, Heidegger, and 
Scarlet stand at the end of the long table. Reeve turns to Heidegger.) 
Reeve: "Looks like Cloud and the others are on their way. Stay out of the 
way!" 
 
Heidegger: "Ghaa haah hah hah!" "Don't be so ludicrous! I don't recall you giving me any orders!" "The Peace Preservation will give their best effort to make the 
enemy retreat!" 
 
Heidegger: "Because of them, I…… I..!" 
Reeve: "That's a private matter……" 
Heidegger: "The President is dead! Now I'm doing things my way!" "Ghaa haah hah hah!" 
Scarlet: "Ha, ha, ha." "Heidegger! Now I'm going to use the new weapon!" 
(Two guards come in and surround Reeve. Scarlet and Heidegger laugh and 
exit.) 
Reeve: "Hey! Wait!!" 
 
Reeve: "Cloud, everybody! Sorry……" "But!!" 
 
Cait-Sith: "But!" "But you'll come, won't you!?" 
 
Cloud: "I know!" 
 
Cid: "Hey!" 
 
Cid: "I'm leaving the ship in your hands!" 
 
"I'm heading for Midgar!" 
  
Parachute Into Midgar Turk Settlement The Proud Clod Hojo 
Transforms -
(Cloud pilots the Highwind to enter Midgar airspace. The  shifts to 
the bridge of the Highwind. A crewman salutes and clicks his heels.) 
"We've reached Midgar!" 
Barret: "Even if we get there, Midgar's under martial law!" "There'll be no way we could slip into the slums." 
Tifa: "Looks like all transportation from the slums is cut off……" 
Cid: "Hey, hey, whaddya think we have Highwind for?" "Where are we now!?"
Barret: "Huh? Where are we…?" 
Cid: "If land's no go… We'll go by air!" 
Cloud: "Okay then! We'll parachute into Midgar!!" 
(All exit the bridge. Crewmen salute as they run past, single file, onto 
the outer deck. Cloud steps to the railing.) 
Cloud: "Here we go!!" 
(They all leap over the railing. FMV sequence. As the Highwind flies 
overhead, the party plummets past. The camera follows as they fall high 
above Midgar, finally opening their chutes just above the city streets. 
Cloud lands softly near an alley. Cait-Sith comes bounding up.) 
Cait-Sith: "Heidegger is going after you all." "That's why it's dangerous out there. Let's go underground!"
(He runs off into the alley. Cloud follows to find the rest of the party 
waiting there.)
Barret: "Sounds strange comin' from me…"
"But it feels like home bein' back in
Midgar." "Kinda makes me sick…" 
Red XIII: "I have an old score to settle with Hojo, so let's hurry and go!" 
(Cait-Sith is dancing with excitement next to a storm door at the end of 
the alley. Cloud speaks to him and the music fades.) 
Cait-Sith: "This is where we go in." 
 
Cait-Sith: "Please! Hurry and come to the Mako Cannon!" 
(He leaps down the storm door. Cloud follows. Beneath the storm door is a 
vast maze of pipes, walkways, and ladders. Traversing the mechanical rooms, 
Cloud arrives in the subway beneath Midgar. He begins to head through it 
when he hears a voice behind him.) 
"Oh no! They're here!" 
 
Elena: "What are we going to do!? I think it's okay for you to ignore 
your orders now." 
 
Reno: "…Elena, don't act so weak." 
 
Rude: "We're Turks, Elena." 
 
Elena: "…Yes, sir. You're right." 
Rude: "Come on, we've got work to do." 
Reno: "I'm not really up for it, but…" 
Elena: "Our orders were to seek you out and…" "…Kill." "Our company may be in turmoil, but an order's an order." "That's the will and spirit of the Turks! Believe it!" 
 
Cloud: "……" 
Elena: "What are you doing! Let's go!" 
Okay, let's end this: No, let's not go 
Cloud: Okay, let's end this 
 
Reno: "I know we've got a weird relationship, but…" "We have to end this… like Turks!" 
 
Cloud: No, let's not go 
 
Elena: "You're showing pity!? Don't take the Turks for fools!" 
Reno: "Wait, Elena." 
 
Elena: "Reno! You're not violating the order… are you!?" 
Reno: "Shinra's finished. It's come down to this." 
Rude: "……" 
 
Elena: "Rude…" 
 
Reno: "Elena, you were a great Turk!" 
 
Elena: "……" 
 
Reno: "Farewell. If we both survive…" "If we can save our lives…" 
 
Elena: "Remember the spirit of the Turks…!" 
 
Rude: "Our mission's finished…" 
(He turns and leaves. The party continues on. A bit further down the 
subway, they reach an exit that takes them to an exterior street of 
Midgar. They climb a tower marked '59' to reach an upper road and are 
about to continue when they hear huge robotic footsteps behind them, 
getting closer and closer.)
Tifa: "This can't be…" 
 
Cid: "Hey-hey! You serious…?" 
(A door in the front of the robot swings open. The robot lifts a huge 
hand to the opening.) 
"G'yaaa, Haaa, Haaa!!! Here they come!" 
 
"G'yaaa, Haaa, Haaa!!! So they really showed up!" 
(Scarlet exits the robot and stands next to Heidegger. The robot swings 
its hand outwards, holding them both.) 
Heidegger: "You sure did treat us like dogs up to now!!" 
Scarlet: "You killed off a lot of my precious soldiers!" 
 
Heidegger: "G'yaaa, Haaa, Haaa!!! But let's see how you do against 
anti-Weapon artillery!" 
Scarlet: "You guys are worthless, but my proud creation is a sure thing!" 
(She gestures and the robot deposits the two of them back inside. The 
door swings closed as it swings a massive fist down to punch the ground 
near the party.) 
Scarlet: "I'll show you the destructive power of the Proud Clod!" 
 
 
Scarlet: "Not that! This is the Proud Clod…………!?" 
(It begins to glow white and makes thundering sounds. It falls to its 
knees.) 
Heidegger: "Whoooooooa!!" 
(The screen goes white as it explodes. It begins to rain. The party 
continues. They head north along the street, reaching a set of wooden 
stairs. Cait-Sith is waiting at the top.) 
Cait-Sith: "This way, Cloud!" 
(He bounds up the stairs and motions for them to follow. They do so. They 
continue to climb the stairs, ascending a huge metal tower. At the top 
is a large instrument panel. Hojo is feverishly pressing buttons and 
flipping switches.) 
Cloud: "Hojo! Stop right there!!" 
 
Hojo: "Oh… the failure." 
Cloud: "At least remember my name! It's Cloud!" 
 
Hojo: "Every time I see you, I…" "It pains me that I had so little scientific sense…" 
 
Hojo: "I evaluated you as a failed project." "But, you are the only one that succeeded as a Sephiroth-clone." "Heh, heh, heh……… I'm even beginning to hate myself." 
Cloud: "None of that matters… just stop this nonsense!" 
Hojo: "…nonsense?" "Oh, this?" 
 
Hojo: "Ha, ha, ha…" "Sephiroth seems to be counting on the energy." "So I'm going to lend him a hand." 
Cloud: "Why!? Why do that!?" 
Hojo: "Quit asking me why, you moron." 
 
Hojo: "Hmm… actually, you might be cut out to be a scientist." 
 
Hojo: "Energy level is at…… 83%. It's taking too long." 
 
Hojo: "My son is in need of power and help. …That's the only reason." 
Cloud: "…your son?" 
Hojo: "Ha, ha, ha… Although he doesn't know." 
 
Hojo: "Ha, ha, ha… HA, HA, HA…!!" "What will Sephiroth think when he finds out that I'm his father?" "Always looking down on me like that." "HA, HA, HA…!!" 
Cloud: "Sephiroth is your son!?" 
 
Hojo: "Ha, ha, ha…" "I offered the woman with my child to Professor Gast's Jenova 
Project." "When Sephiroth was still in the womb, we took the cells of 
Jenova…" "HA, HA, HA!!" 
Cloud: "I can't believe you're the one who did this…" "The illusionary crime against Sephiroth…" 
(Hojo stops and calmly turns to face Cloud. They stare at each other for a 
long moment, then Hojo begins to laugh.) 
Hojo: "Heee, hee, hee, hee! No, you're wrong!" "It's my desire as a scientist! Heee, hee, hee, hee!" 
 
Hojo: "I… was defeated by my desire to
become a scientist." "I lost the last time as well." 
 
Hojo: "I've injected Jenova's cells into my
own body!" "Heee, hee, hee!" "Here are……" "Heee, hee, hee!" "…my results!!" 
(Boss battle with Hojo. He undergoes three transformations during the 
battle, each more deformed than the last, as Jenova's cells take effect.) 
Cloud: "……" 
 
Cid: "%$#&$*&^%^" 
Tifa: "I can't believe Sephiroth is Hojo's son…" 
  
  
Seven Days We Have A Reason To Fight -
 
Cait-Sith: "Shinra's…… finished." 
 
Cloud: "Meteor's gonna fall in about……" 
 
Red XIII: "Seven more days. That's what Grandfather said." 
 
Cloud: "Red XIII………" "You want to see everyone in Cosmo Canyon again?" 
 
Red XIII: "………yes." 
(He turns back to him. Cloud turns to Barret, who is gazing out at the 
clouds below.) 
Cloud: "You want to see Marlene, right?" 
 
Barret: "Don't ask me that." 
 
Cloud: "We'll beat Sephiroth…" "Then, if we don't release the power of Holy in seven 
days………" "There won't be a planet left to protect." 
 
Cloud: "If we can't beat Sephiroth…" "It's as good as death for us." "We'll just go a few days sooner than the rest who'll die from 
Meteor." 
Barret: "Don't be thinkin' you're gonna lose before ya even fight!" 
Cloud: "No!" 
 
Cloud: "What I meant was…" 
 
Cloud: "What are we all fighting for? I want us all to understand that." "Save the planet… for the future of the planet… Sure, that's 
all fine." "But really, is that really how it is?" 
 
Cloud: "For me, this is a personal feud." "I want to beat Sephiroth. And settle my past." "Saving the planet just happens to be a part of that." "I've been thinking." 
 
Cloud: "I think we all are fighting for ourselves." "For ourselves… and that someone… something… whatever it 
is, that's important to us." "That's what we're fighting for." "That's why we keep up this battle for the planet." 
 
Barret: "You're right…" "It sounds cool sayin' it's to save the planet." "But I was the one who blew up that Mako reactor……" "Lookin' back on it now, I can see that wasn't the right way to 
do things." "I made a lot of friends and innocent bystanders suffer…" 
 
Barret: "…At first, it was for revenge against Shinra. For attackin' my 
town." "But now……" "Yeah. I'm fightin' for Marlene." "For Marlene… For Marlene's future…" "Yeah… I guess I want to save the planet for Marlene's sake…" 
 
Cloud: "Go and see her. Make sure you're right, and come back." 
 
Cloud: "All of you. Get off the ship and find out your reasons for 
yourselves." "I want you to make sure. Then I want you to come back." 
Cid: "Maybe ain't none of us'll come back." "Meteor's just gonna kill us all anyway. Let's just forget any 
useless struggling!" 
 
Cloud: "I know why I'm fighting." "I'm fighting to save the planet, and that's that." "But besides that, there's something personal too…" "A very personal memory that I have." "What about you all?" "I want all of you to find that something within yourselves." "If you don't find it, then that's okay too." "You can't fight without a reason, right?" "So, I won't hold it against you if you don't come back." 
(He nods. Cid rubs the back of his head and turns to the pilot. The  
fades to black.)  
  
Understanding -
(The  fades in to show Cloud and Tifa alone on the bridge. Tifa is 
still watching the clouds go by.) 
Cloud: "What are you going to do, Tifa?" 
 
Tifa: "Did you forget?" "I'm… all alone. I don't have anywhere to go." 
(The  fades out, then in to show Cloud and Tifa on a grassy hill. 
Tifa stands close to the camera, looking past the player. Cloud is behind 
her, staring in another direction. The Highwind hovers above. The only 
sound is that of the wind.) 
Tifa: "Everyone's gone…" 
Cloud: "Yeah, we don't have anywhere or anyone to go home to." 
 
Tifa: "You're right…" 
 
Tifa: "But… I'm sure someday… they'll come back, don't you think?" 
 
Cloud: "Hmm… I wonder…?" "Everyone has an irreplaceable something they're holding on to…" "But this time, our opponent…" 
 
Tifa: "Hmm… But that's all right, even if no one comes back." "As long as I'm with you… As long as you're by my side… I 
won't give up even if I'm scared." 
 
Cloud: "…… Tifa……" 
 
Tifa: "No matter how close we are… We were far apart… before this." "But when we were in the Lifestream surrounded by all those 
screams of anguish, I thought I heard your voice…" 

Tifa: "…sniff… you probably don't remember this…" "But deep in my heart I heard you calling my name… Or at least 
I thought I did…" 
 
Cloud: "Yeah… At that time I heard you calling me." "You were calling me back in from the stream of consciousness in 
the Lifestream." 
 
Cloud: "After all, I promised. That if anything were to ever happen to 
you, I would come to help." 
 
Tifa: "Cloud…? Do you think the stars can hear us?" 
 
Tifa: "Do you think they see how hard we're fighting for them?" 
 
Cloud: "I dunno… But…" "Whether they are or not, we still have to do what we can. And 
believe in ourselves…" "Someday we'll find the answer. Right, Tifa?" "That's what I learned from you when I was in the Lifestream." 
 
Tifa: "Yeah…… that's right…" 

Cloud: "Hey, Tifa…… I…… There are a lot of things I wanted to 
talk to you about." 
 
Cloud: "But now that we're together like this, I don't know what I 
really wanted to say…" "I guess nothing's changed at all… Kind of makes you want to 
laugh…" 
 
Tifa: "Cloud… Words aren't the only thing that tell people what 
you're thinking…" 

Cloud: "…………" 


Cloud: "…………It's almost dawn…" 
Tifa: "H, huh…?" 
 
Cloud: "Sorry. Did I wake you…? It's almost dawn, Tifa." 
 
Tifa: "Umm… G, good morning… Cloud." "Give me a little longer… Just a little bit longer…" 
 
Tifa: "This day will never come again… So let me have this moment…" 
 
Cloud: "Yeah… okay." 
 
Cloud: "This is probably the last time we'll have together……" 


Tifa: "…………" 
 
Cloud: "We'd better go." 
 
Tifa: "But, I still…!?" 
 
Cloud: "It's all right, Tifa. You said so yourself yesterday." "At least we don't have to go on alone." 
 
Tifa: "Yes… That's right!" 
 
Cloud: "Okay! Let's go!" 

Tifa: "The airship is too big for just the two of us." "Yeah, it's a little lonely without everyone." 
 
Cloud: "Don't worry. It'll be okay." 
 
Cloud: "I'll make a big enough ruckus for everyone." 
 
Cloud: "Besides, I'm the pilot." "No more flying around casually like before." "We won't have time to feel lonely." 

Tifa: "Huh!?" 
 
Cloud: "It's moving……"

Cloud: "Barret! Cid!" 
 
Barret: "O, oh…… is that okay with you?" 
 
Cloud: "Red XIII!" 
 
Tifa: "Why didn't you tell me!?" 
 
Red XIII: "But, you know, Cid." 
 
Cid: "Hey, Red XIII." "If you butt in now, you never know what they'll say later……" 
Tifa: "……Were you watching?" 

Cloud: "Vincent!" 
 
Vincent: "Why the puzzled look?" "Don't you want me to come?" 
 
Cloud: "No, it's just that you're always so cold. I thought you didn't 
care what was happening." 
 
Vincent: "Cool?" "Hmmm…… I guess that's just how I am, sorry." 

Barret: "Well lookey-here. The Shinra manager's come back." 

Cait-Sith: "Uh, excuse me but…" "I wanted to come with the main group, but I couldn't get 
away……" "So some people in Midgar took me in." 
 
Cait-Sith: "I know I have a stuffed animal body, but I'll work really hard!" 
 
Barret: "I guess that's everyone." 
 
Red XIII: "No, Yuffie's missing." 
Barret: "She ain't gonna show up." "'Least this time she didn't steal our materia. Guess we gotta 
be thankful for that."
(Yuffie suddenly drops down from the ceiling, lands in the middle of the 
group, and shadowboxes energetically.) 
Yuffie: "How could you say that!?" 
 
Yuffie: "I came all the way here after being seasick as a dog!" 
 

Yuffie: "I didn't go through all that just to have you guys have the 
best parts all to yourselves!" 
 
Cloud: "Welcome back, Yuffie." 
Yuffie: "Gee, Cloud…… that's so nice of you to say that. ……You 
sick?" 
 
Yuffie: "Well, whatever. I'm gonna be in my reserved seat in the 
hall…… waiting…… upp! ……Urk!" 

Cloud: "Thanks everyone." 
 
Barret: "We didn't come back for your spikey headed ass!" "We came back for Marlene. Guess it's jes' my…… whatcha call, 
feelings or somethin'." "I, uh, I ain't got no words now……" 
 
Red XIII: "……Although she's not here, she left us a window of 
opportunity…"
 
Cid: "We can't let it go like this." 
 
Cloud: "……Aerith." "She was smiling to the end." "We have to do something, or that smile will just freeze like 
that." 
 
Cloud: "Let's all go together." "Memories of Aerith……" "Although she should've returned to the planet by now, something 
stopped her and now she's stuck……" "We've got to let go of Aerith's memory." 
 
Cid: "Has anyone here changed their mind?" 
 
Cloud: "I'm counting on you, Cid." 
Cid: "Yeah, yeah……" "There are 2 levers here that've been buggin' me for a while 
now…" 
 
Cid: "Let me try them out." 
 
Cid: "All right, so what should I do?" "You decide, Cloud." 

Cloud: "This is our last battle." "Our target is the North Cave. Our enemy is…… Sephiroth!" 
 
Cloud: "So let's move out!" 

Cloud: "We're almost to the North Cave!
We're on our way, Sephiroth!" 
Cid: "Man, I'm going to stick it to him!" 

Cloud: "What is it, Cid?" 
Cid: "Errrrggh! Some incredible force! Losing… control……!" 

Cid: "Get the hell outta here, flunkies! Didn't I tell you all to go 
home!?" 
"Yes, sir. This is our home!!" 
Cid: "Oh ma- ……stop trying to act so cool." "All right, you jokers! Hold me down with everything you got!!" "Geronimo!!" 
(He pushes the Highwind to the red-line; the screen goes white with energy 
as the Highwind speeds off. The  fades to black.)  

END OF DISC 2 

  
The North Crater -
(The  fades in to show the mural of a bikini-clad woman painted on 
the side of the Highwind. The camera pans down to show the rest of the 
ship; it is docked just outside the North Crater. A crewman marches to the 
railing and unrolls a rope ladder over the side, offering passage down 
into Sephiroth's lair.) 
People on the Highwind 
Yuffie: "Huh?" "How would you even know? You don't know how tough it is… 
getting sick on boats and rides……" "So, please…… just leave me alone." 
Cloud: "……I really do understand, Yuffie. When I get sick on a 
flight, it's a real killer." "When I was in SOLDIER, I completely forgot about my motion 
sickness." 
Yuffie: "Oh……" "Isn't there any way to prevent this?" 
Cloud: "Well, according to my research……" 
 
Cloud: "First off, if you're nervous a lot, you won't get sick." "But you can't always be nervous." 
 
Cloud: "With this much space, your best bet is to move around while 
you're riding." "It also might be a good idea to stretch sometimes, too." "But in SOLDIER, we spent a lot of time in trucks." "That sucked!……" 
 
Cloud: "And there's one thing you mustn't do when riding." "And that is……" 
 
Cloud: "Read!" "Once you get sick, there's nothing anyone can do." "I know it's tough……" 
 
Yuffie: "……so you're a little better off than me." "But I don't feel…… well." 
 
Yuffie: "Cloud…… sign this." 
Cloud: "What is it?" 
Yuffie: "It's a contract that says when the war is over, all the materia 
will belong to me." "It's all in there. Read it carefully and then sign it, all 
right?" 
 
Cloud: "Forget it, Yuffie. I'm not even gonna read it." "Whenever I read, I get airsick." 
Yuffie: "Oh yeah……?" "I'm the same way, so I can't say too much……" "Damn! My plan failed. Let's pick on Red XIII later to let off 
steam." 
Cait-Sith: "But I ain't gonna forget, no matter what happens." "Not about this here trip, or them folks- none of it!" 
Red XIII: "I am Nanaki, son of Seto… I am afraid of nothing…" "It's all right, all right. I'm Nanaki, the son of brave Seto… 
I'm not afraid of Sephiroth…" 
Vincent: "Cloud…… take the ship to the Northern Cave." "The time for flying is now past." "Our battlefield is now beneath the earth…" "The gate to tomorrow is not the light of heaven, but the 
darkness of the depths of the earth…….." 
Barret: "Heh heh…… heh heh heh… Time's got a way of sneakin' up on 
ya, huh?" "I'm shakin' all over… Heh heh… I feel sick…" 
Tifa: "Hey, Cloud… Would you tell me 'It's all right'?" 
Say it cool: Say it normal: Don't say it 
Cloud: Say it cool 
 
Cloud: "It's all right, Tifa." 
 
Tifa: "Now I feel like things are really going to be all right." "Thanks, Cloud." 
Cloud: Say it normal 
 
Cloud: "…It's all right." 
Tifa: "You're right, things will be all right." 
Cloud: Don't say it 
 
Cloud: "…I just can't say it that easy." 
 
Tifa: "I'm sorry… I guess you're right." 

Cid: "You ever see the play 'LOVELESS'?" 
No: Yes 
Cloud: No 
Cid: "Yeah, I figured someone like you wouldn't be much on plays." 
Cloud: Yes 
Cid: "Yeah? Really? Well, that's fine." "They've been doin' that play every summer since I was a kid." "An' I remember seein' it just once…" "That was when I was in Midgar interviewing to be a pilot." "I had some free time and thought I'd catch the play." "Now, I'm no big fan of the theater or anything." "But this thing put me to sleep, just like I thought it would." "Finally during the last scene, the guy next to me woke me up 
tellin' me my snorin' was too loud." "So about all I really remember of that play is the end…" "The sister of the lead asks her lover," 
 
Cid: "Do you really have to leave?" 
 
Cid: "And the guy says," 
 
Cid: "I promised. The people I love are waiting." 
 
Cid: "……I don't understand. Not at all. But…… please take care 
of yourself." 
 
Cid: "Of course… I'll come back to you. Even if you don't promise to 
wait. I'll return knowing that you'll be here." 
 
Cid: "I remember thinking when I heard those lines," "*&%! What the hell's he talkin' about? But, you know… now I'm 
not so sure…" "I think I understand……" 
(Cloud climbs down the rope ladder and into the North Crater. A ways away 
from the Highwind, he reaches a steep dropoff down into the depths of the 
cave.) 
Cloud: "Looks like we can only slide down." 
Alright, let's go! We'll get prepared first 
Cloud: Alright, let's go! 
 
Cloud: We'll get prepared first 
 
Cloud: "The road splits in two. We'll split into two groups." 
 
Cid: "Which you gonna choose, Cloud?" 
Barret: "All right. Then I'll go…" 
Tifa: "Then I'm going…" 
Red XIII: "All right, then I'll go…" 
Yuffie: "I'm going……" 
Cait-Sith: "Then I'll be heading…" 
Vincent: "Then, I will be going……" 
Cid: "All right! I'm headin'…" 
 
Cloud: "Now don't any of you die on me. ……" "Gotta get through to Sephiroth!" 
Vincent: "It's all over now. With this…" 
Yuffie: "Oh man… 'Materia Hunter Yuffie' sounds like the last chapter 
of 'Materia Forever.'" 
Red XIII: "All life on this planet, indeed the very life of this planet is 
in our hands…" 
Cait-Sith: "I'm so happy to have met you all, really! …sniff…" 
Barret: "Well…… Looks like this is our last big job!" 
 
Cloud: "This will be the end of it!" 

Barret: "Yo, we're a bit late?" 

Cloud: "This is the center of the Planet…?"
 
Cid: "Let's just get this over with!" 
Tifa: "This is it." 
Barret: "Here, Cloud." 
 
Red XIII: "Cloud, I found this…" 
 
Cait-Sith: "Hey Cloud, I found this." 
 
Vincent: "Hold on to this." 
 
Yuffie: "………Wh… what?" 
Barret: "Oh yeah, Yuffie, didn't you find somethin'?" 
 
Yuffie: "Oh, all right." "Here, Cloud." 
 
Yuffie: "But I'm the one who found it, so you better give it back to me 
when you're done with it!" 
Barret: "Awright, this's the last dance!" 
Red XIII: "We finally made it here." 
Cait-Sith: "Well, shall we get goin'?" 
Vincent: "Hmm… Being with you all is not so bad." 

Cloud: "All right, everyone, let's mosey." 
Cid: "Damn! Again!" "Stop sayin' it like a wimp!" "Can't you say 'Move out!' or somethin'?" 
 
Cloud: "Move out!!" 
 
Barret: "What?" 
 
Red XIII: "Look at the number…" 
 
Cid: "%#@^! They're comin' out in force!" 
Barret: "Cloud! You go first!" 
 
Cloud: "I'm fighting here too." 
Barret: "Shu'up! It won't do us no good wit' everyone back here!" 
Cid: "Barret's right." "You take two of us with you and go first. The rest'll catch up 
with ya later." 
Tifa: "Is this like a practice run before the real thing?" 
Cait-Sith: "Yeah, a major practice run…" 
 
Yuffie: "Heh heh, I'm fine with that." It's probably more fun than 
fighting Sephiroth down there.
Vincent: "Hmm, this might be fun to pass time." 
 
Red XIII: "They're coming! They're already on the floor next to us!" 
 
Barret: "Cloud! Hurry up and make up your mind!" 
 
Cloud: "All of you!" 
 
Cloud: "Later!" 
 
Barret: "Yeah, later." 

Cloud: "Where are we…?" 
 
Tifa: "What!?" 

Cloud: "Jenova…!?" 
 
Barret: "Oww… damn, man!" 
 
Cloud: "Barret!?" 
 
Barret: "What…? So everyone's together again…?" 

"Uuuugh…!!" 

Cloud: "…Sephiroth!!" 

Barret: "Ugh…! Is this…… the true power of Sephiroth?" 
Cid: "My… my body… I can't control my body…… Uuugh!?" 

Red XIII: "My front legs…… my hind legs…… my tail's about to tear 
off!!" 
Cait-Sith: "This is definitely not good…… He's way outta our league…" 
Yuffie: "I, I don't know if I can… go on…" 
 
Tifa: "Cloud… Cloud…" 
Cloud: "Ugh… ugh…" 
 
Cloud: "…there…" "It's…… there…" 
Tifa: "Cloud…?" 
 
Cloud: "…Holy…… Holy… is there……" "The Holy is shining…… Aerith's prayer is shining……!" 
Tifa: "Holy…… Aerith……" 
 
Cloud: "It's not over yet…… This isn't the
end yet!!" 

"Eyaaaah-----!" 
Tifa: "…We're not gonna lose!!" 
 
Tifa: "Aerith is here… everyone is here… Cloud is here with us!" "There's still many things for us to do… I'm not giving up!!" 
 
Cid: "Hoo-ok……! I can't be foolin' around in the bottom of this 
hell hole…" "I still have lots of stuff to do with my life!" 
 
Cloud: "Aerith's memories… Our memories…" "We came… to tell you… our memories… Come Planet! Show us 
your answer!" "And Sephiroth! To the settling of everything!!" 

 
Estuans interius  
Ira vehementi  
Sephiroth!  
Sors immanis  
Et inanis  
Sephiroth!  
Veni, veni, venias  
Ne me mori facias  
Sephiroth! 
 

Cloud: "This was all we could do." 
 
Barret: "Wait! What about Holy? What's gonna happen to the Planet?" 
 
Cloud: "That… I don't know. Isn't the rest up to the Planet?" 
Tifa: "…You're right." "We've done all that we could do." 
 
Cloud: "All right, everyone." "It's no use thinking about it." "We'll leave all our worries here." 
 
Cloud: "Let's go home proud." 

Tifa: "What happened?" 
 
Cloud: "……I feel it…" 
Tifa: "What……" 

Cloud shakes his head.) 
Cloud: "He is still…… here." 

Cloud: "Still……" 
 
Tifa: "Cloud!?" 
 
Cloud: "He's… laughing…" 
(Cloud's double removes from his body and spins off into the distance. The 
screen goes white once more.) 
Tifa: "Cloud!" 
   
The Beginning of the End -
 
…….Lifestream? 

……I think I'm beginning to understand. 
 
What? 
 
An answer from the Planet… the Promised Land… I think I can meet her… there. 
 
Yeah, let's go meet her. 

Hey, where is everyone? 

Heeeey! 
 
I'm glad you're all safe! 
 
They all seem to be safe, too. But… now what're we going to do? 
 
Holy should be moving soon, and that means this place will… 
 
Oh, Lady Luck don't fail me now… 

Shit!! 

The flower girl? 

Wait a damn minute! 
 
What's going to happen to Midgar? 
 
We can't let that happen! 
 
I had everyone take refuge in the slums, 
 
but the way things are now… 
(He wipes a tear with the back of one of his white cartoon gloves. Red 
XIII comes forward, the red fire below further reddening his coat.) 
It's too late for Holy. Meteor is approaching the Planet. 
 
Holy is having the opposite effect. 

What's that!? 

What the hell IS that……? 
 
……Lifestream. 

It's coming.
